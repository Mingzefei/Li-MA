  abstract = {Battery electrode surfaces are generally coated with electronically insulating solid films of thickness 1-50 nm. Both electrons and Li+ can move at the electrode-surface film interface in response to the voltage, which adds complexity to the ``electric double layer'' (EDL). We apply Density Functional Theory (DFT) to investigate how the applied voltage is manifested as changes in the EDL at atomic length scales, including charge separation and interfacial dipole moments. Illustrating examples include Li3PO4, Li2CO3, and LixMn2O4 thin films on Au(111) surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Adsorbed organic solvent molecules can strongly reduce voltages predicted in vacuum. We propose that manipulating surface dipoles, seldom discussed in battery studies, may be a viable strategy to improve electrode passivation. We also distinguish the computed potential governing electrons, which is the actual or instantaneous voltage, and the ``lithium cohesive energy''-based voltage governing Li content widely reported in DFT calculations, which is a slower-responding self-consistency criterion at interfaces. This distinction is critical for a comprehensive description of electrochemical activities on electrode surfaces, including Li+ insertion dynamics, parasitic electrolyte decomposition, and electrodeposition at overpotentials.},

  abstract = {Understanding of the electrical conduction, that is, ionic and electronic conduction, through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is critical to the design of durable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with high rate capability and long life. It is believed that an ideal SEI should not only be an ionic conductor, but also an electronic insulator. In this study, we present a theoretical design of an artificial SEI consisting of lithium fluoride (LiF) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) on a LIB anode based on a newly developed density functional theory (DFT) informed space charge model. We demonstrate that the migration of lattice Li ions from LiF phase to form Li interstitials in Li2CO3 is energetically favorable near the LiF/ Li2CO3 interface. At equilibrium, this interfacial defect reaction establishes a space charge potential across the interface, which causes the accumulation of ionic carriers but the depletion of electronic carriers near the LiF/Li2CO3 interface. To utilize this space charge effect, we propose a computationally designed, nanostructured artificial SEI structure with high density of interfaces of LiF and Li2CO3 perpendicular to the electrode. On the basis of this structure, the influences of grain size and volume ratio of the two phases were studied. Our results reveal that reducing the grain size of Li2CO3 in the nanostructured composite can promote ionic carriers and increase the ionic conductivity through the composite SEI by orders of magnitude. At the same time, the electronic conductivity is reduced due to electron depletion near the LiF/Li2CO3 interface. Furthermore, an optimal volume fraction that ensures high ionic and low electronic conduction was predicted.},

While LiX surface layers or the interfacial core serves as hosts for extra Li, atoms of contacting transition metal serve as electron sinks, depending on Me electronegativity. To verify the mechanism, we have performed comparative DFT-LCAO calculations on the polar TijLijLi2O(111) and non-polar CujLijLiF(001) interfaces with extra Li atoms inserted inside both 2D interfaces, gradually changing their concentration. Theoretical calculations confirm validity of this interfacial model for explanation of the extra storage capacity at low potentials. The diffusion barrier for extra Li atom along the Me/LiX interface is markedly smaller than the Li penetration barrier into the bulk.},

  abstract = {The mechanism of Li+ transport through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), a passivating film on electrode surfaces, has never been clearly elucidated despite its overwhelming importance to Li-ion battery operation and lifetime. The present paper develops a multiscale theoretical methodology to reveal the mechanism of Li+ transport in a SEI film. The methodology incorporates the boundary conditions of the first direct diffusion measurements on a model SEI consisting of porous (outer) organic and dense (inner) inorganic layers (similar to typical SEI films). New experimental evidence confirms that the inner layer in the {$\sim$}20 nm thick model SEI is primarily crystalline Li2CO3. Using density functional theory, we first determined that the dominant diffusion carrier in Li2CO3 below the voltage range of SEI formation is excess interstitial Li+. This diffuses via a knock-of f mechanism to maintain higher O-coordination, rather than direct-hopping through empty spaces in the Li2CO3 lattice. Mesoscale diffusion equations were then formulated upon a new two-layer/two-mechanism model: pore diffusion in the outer layer and knock-off diffusion in the inner layer. This diffusion model predicted the unusual isotope ratio 6Li+/7Li+ profile measured by TOF-SIMS, which increases from the SEI/electrolyte surface and peaks at a depth of 5 nm, and then gradually decreases within the dense layer. With no fitting parameters, our approach is applicable to model general transport properties, such as ionic conductivity, for SEI films on the surface of other electrodes, from the atomic scale to the mesoscale, as well as aging phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Understanding and improving Li transport through crystalline Li2CO3, a stable component of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) films in Li-ion batteries, is critical to battery rate performance, capacity drop, and power loss. Identification of the dominant diffusion carriers and their diffusion pathways in SEI films coated on anode and cathode surfaces is a necessary step toward the development of methods to increase Li conductivity. In this paper, we identify the dominant Li diffusion carriers in Li2CO3 over a voltage range (0-4.4 V) that includes typical anode and cathode materials by computing and comparing thermodynamics of all seven Li-associated point defects with density functional theory (DFT). The main diffusion carriers in Li2CO3 below 0.98 V are excess Li-ion interstitials; however, above 3.98 V, Li-ion vacancies become the dominant diffusion carrier type, and they have the same concentration in the voltage range of 0.98-3.98 V. Diffusion mechanisms of the main diffusion carriers were computed via the climbing image nudged elastic band method (CI-NEB). On the basis of the computed diffusion carrier concentration and diffusion barriers, the Li ionic conductivity was computed as a function of voltage, and it varies by {$\sim$}5 orders of magnitude. Insights gained from our calculations allow us to suggest different dopants to enhance Li conductivity in SEI films and propose a new mechanism for electron leakage through an SEI film into the electrolyte. Li2CO3 is the one of the main stable components in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in lithium-ion batteries and can be found in SEI films grown on both cathode and anode surfaces. On the basis of the concentrations and diffusion barriers computed for each of the identified point defects from first-principles calculations, the Li conductivity in Li2CO3 is mapped as a function of battery voltage. It is found that the diffusion carriers in the Li2CO3 on a negative electrode (graphite) are Li+ interstitials but changed to Li+ vacancies in the Li2CO3 coated on cathode materials. While Li+ vacancies diffuse via a typical direct hopping mechanism, the excess Li+ interstitials diffuse via repetitive knock-off with the Li+ ions on lattice sites. The Li+ interstitial conductivity in Li2CO3 on graphite is {$\sim$}5 orders of magnitude faster than that of a Li+ vacancy in Li2CO3 on the cathode. This suggests that Li transport through an SEI film on a cathode material can be dramatically different from Li transport through an SEI film on an anode material, despite the fact that SEI component chemistries appear to be similar in both cases. Thus, different doping strategies for the SEI on the anode and cathode could be taken to increase diffusion carrier concentrations in order to increase Li conductivity in an SEI film.},

  abstract = {The formation and continuous growth of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer are responsible for the irreversible capacity loss of batteries in the initial and subsequent cycles, respectively. In this article, the electron tunneling barriers from Li metal through three insulating SEI components, namely Li2CO3, LiF and Li3PO4, are computed by density function theory (DFT) approaches. Based on electron tunneling theory, it is estimated that sufficient to block electron tunneling. It is also found that the band gap decreases under tension while the work function remains the same, and thus the tunneling barrier decreases under tension and increases under compression. A new parameter, h, characterizing the average distances between anions, is proposed to unify the variation of band gap with strain under different loading conditions into a single linear function of h. An analytical model based on the tunneling results is developed to connect the irreversible capacity loss, due to the Li ions consumed in forming these SEI component layers on the surface of negative electrodes. The agreement between the model predictions and experimental results suggests that only the initial irreversible capacity loss is due to the self-limiting electron tunneling property of the SEI.},

We have considered SEI growth on both Li metal surfaces and using a simulation framework that allows us to vary the Li surface density on the anode surface. Using our simulations we have obtained the detailed structure and distribution of different constituents in the SEI as a function of the distance from the anode surfaces. We find that SEI films formed in the presence of EC are rich in Li2CO3 and Li2O, while LiOCH3 is the primary constituent of DMC films. We find that dilithium ethylene dicarbonate, LiEDC, is formed in the presence of EC at low Li surface densities, but it quickly decomposes to inorganic salts during subsequent growth in Li rich environments. The surface films formed in our simulations have a multilayer structure with regions rich in inorganic and organic salts located near the anode surface and the electrolyte interface, respectively, in agreement with depth profiling experiments. Our computed formation potentials 1.0 V vs. Li/Li+ is also in excellent accord with experimental measurements. We have also calculated the elastic stiffness of the SEI films; we find that they are significantly stiffer than Li metal, but are somewhat more compliant compared to the graphite anode.},

This architecture gives flexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous "parameter server" designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with a focus on training and inference on deep neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataflow model and demonstrate the compelling performance that TensorFlow achieves for several real-world applications.},

There is a critical need for time- and cost-efficient strategies to analyze and interpret these data to advance human health. The recent rise of machine learning as a powerful technique to integrate multimodality, multifidelity data, and reveal correlations between intertwined phenomena presents a special opportunity in this regard. However, machine learning alone ignores the fundamental laws of physics and can result in ill-posed problems or non-physical solutions. Multiscale modeling is a successful strategy to integrate multiscale, multiphysics data and uncover mechanisms that explain the emergence of function. However, multiscale modeling alone often fails to efficiently combine large datasets from different sources and different levels of resolution. Here we demonstrate that machine learning and multiscale modeling can naturally complement each other to create robust predictive models that integrate the underlying physics to manage ill-posed problems and explore massive design spaces. We review the current literature, highlight applications and opportunities, address open questions, and discuss potential challenges and limitations in four overarching topical areas: ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, data-driven approaches, and theory-driven approaches. Towards these goals, we leverage expertise in applied mathematics, computer science, computational biology, biophysics, biomechanics, engineering mechanics, experimentation, and medicine. Our multidisciplinary perspective suggests that integrating machine learning and multiscale modeling can provide new insights into disease mechanisms, help identify new targets and treatment strategies, and inform decision making for the benefit of human health.},

  abstract = {There are significant opportunities to optimize drinking water treatment and water resource management using data-driven models. Modelling can help define complex system behaviour, such as water quality and environmental systems, giving insight into expected outcomes from changing conditions. Many water treatment models have been developed, such as predicting treated water quality based on coagulant addition or disinfection by-product formation from chlorination, which can be used to better inform operators of optimal treatment parameters to limit risk and reduce cost. Data-driven models, in particular, present an opportunity to learn relationships from patterns in historical data without the need to pre-define mechanisms or variable interactions. Furthermore, models built on currently monitored data are likely easier to implement since they utilize water quality measures that are already in place. However, data-driven approaches have significant challenges, including increased uncertainty in model validity, challenges in interpreting model behaviour and decision logic, and increased likelihood of incorporating biases from training data. This article presents a review of data-driven model applications in drinking water treatment to highlight opportunities related to protecting source water quality, optimizing treatment processes, and interpreting of sensor data. There is a focus on identifying approaches and algorithms best suited for specific applications and the interpretability of trained models. Successful implementation of data-driven models in critical systems, such as water treatment, requires that models be validated, and a model's decision-making logic can be identified and scrutinized.},

  abstract = {Breakthroughs in performance of Li/Cu with Ni-rich cathodes can be achieved               via               manipulation of anion interfacial chemistry, as uncovered by experiment/modeling.                        ,                             The electrochemical performance and mechanistic effects of incorporating two salts in an ether electrolyte in Li\textendash metal cells were investigated experimentally and               via               molecular scale modeling. Improvements in efficiency and cycling stability over baseline electrolytes in lithium (Li)               versus               copper (Cu) cells were directly correlated to the initial Li-nucleation process, as observed               via               cryogenic-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) prepared cross sections, which revealed that Li films deposited with the bisalt electrolyte were significantly thinner and denser than those from the baseline. This behavior was further traced back to the initial nucleation process               via               cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), which shows stark differences in the morphology and conformality of deposited Li as a function of electrolyte chemistry. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated that the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed from the bisalt electrolyte primarily consists of larger anion fragments, suggesting that the anion chemistry strongly influences the extent of reduction and resulting surface chemistry.               Ab initio               DFT-based and force field-based molecular dynamics calculations revealed the complex interplay (positioning, orientation, reactivity, kinetics) between the FSI               -               and TFSI               -               anions in the double layer at both electrode\textendash electrolyte interfaces and the ramifications for stabilizing these interfaces. As a result of the unique interphasial chemistry brought by this bisalt system, this electrolyte supports an unprecedented (for an ether-based electrolyte) capacity retention ({$>$}88\%) after 300 cycles ({$\sim$}2 months of cycling) in a 4.4 V NMC622-Li cell, and a {$>$}30\% improvement in capacity retention over baseline after 50 cycles in 4.4 V NMC622-Cu ``anode-free'' cells. Altogether, these results provide new insight into how the bisalt effect can be leveraged for regulating the timescale, chemistry, and extent of interfacial reactions. When balanced properly, this promotes efficient plating/deplating of Li, and potentially supports widespread implementation of high nickel content NMC cell configurations with limited or no excess lithium.},

  abstract = {The data-driven discovery of partial differential equations (PDEs) consistent with spatiotemporal data is experiencing a rebirth in machine learning research. Training deep neural networks to learn such data-driven partial differential operators requires extensive spatiotemporal data. For learning coarse-scale PDEs from computational fine-scale simulation data, the training data collection process can be prohibitively expensive. We propose to transformatively facilitate this training data collection process by linking machine learning (here, neural networks) with modern multiscale scientific computation (here, equation-free numerics). These equation-free techniques operate over sparse collections of small, appropriately coupled, space-time subdomains ("patches"), parsimoniously producing the required macro-scale training data. Our illustrative example involves the discovery of effective homogenized equations in one and two dimensions, for problems with fine-scale material property variations. The approach holds promise towards making the discovery of accurate, macro-scale effective materials PDE models possible by efficiently summarizing the physics embodied in "the best" fine-scale simulation models available.},

  author = {Badarinath, Karthik},

  abstract = {Wind power is the fastest-growing energy source and the offshore wind industry is expected to grow by over 80 GW through 2024. There is a need to reduce all associated costs to be competitive in a market that might be fully subsidy-free soon. Adapting a predictive or condition-based maintenance strategy can help in reducing O\&M costs, as it accounts for more than 30\% of the lifetime costs in offshore turbines.This master thesis focuses on developing a novel gearbox condition monitoring technique using raw Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) data from an offshore wind farm. The developed approach attempts to leverage the use of physics of failure technique and artificial neural network models for continuous monitoring of gearbox condition. Utilizing SCADA data for monitoring and fault detection can help in eliminating retrofitting additional expensive sensors such as an online oil monitoring system, vibration monitoring systems and so on for the same purpose.Firstly, a physics of failure methodology is implemented to monitor turbines on a farm level. Using Failure Mode, Effects Analysis (FMEA), the operating regimes under which gears and bearings can potentially get damaged are ascertained. A correlation between the damage operating conditions and the root cause of failure is analyzed using boxplots. In particular, a correlation between operating conditions and, the unusual and unexplained White Etching Cracks or axial cracking failure that occur frequently in the high-speed shaft bearings is studied. Additionally, this methodology is also used to complement the Artificial Neural Network model developed for anomaly detection.Finally, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is developed for fault detection. The model is trained on data when the turbine was operating normally, to predict gear bearing and gearbox lubrication oil temperatures. A stacked Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a type of RNN model with two hidden layers resulted in predictions with the lowest mean squared error (0.14640퐶) and with good generalization. The difference/residual between the measured and ANN predicted temperatures are used to flag anomalies. The ANN-based condition monitoring method is validated through case studies using real data from wind turbines. The results from the case studies indicate that the RNNbased fault detection method can detect a failure in the wind turbine gearbox components as early as 3-6 months before it fails.},

  abstract = {The concept behind the more electric aircraft is the progressive electrification of on-board actuators and services. It is a way to reduce or eliminate the dependence on hydraulic, mechanical, and bleed air/pneumatic systems, and pursue efficiency, reliability, and maintainability. This paper presents a specialized test rig whose main objective is to assess insulation lifespan modeling under various stress conditions, especially investigating the interaction between ageing factors. The test setup is able to reproduce a multitude of environmental and operational conditions at which electric drives and motors, used in aerospace applications, are subjected. It is thus possible to tailor the test cycle in order to mimic the working cycle of an electrical motor during real operation in aircraft application. The developed test-rig is aimed at projecting the technology readiness to higher levels of maturity in the context of electrical motors and drives for aerospace applications. Its other objective is to validate and support the development of a comprehensive insulation degradation model.},

  abstract = {For an ensemble of nonlinear systems that model, for instance, molecules or photonic systems, we propose a method that finds efficiently the configuration that has prescribed transfer properties. Specifically, we use physics-informed machine learning (PIML) techniques to find the parameters for the efficient transfer of an electron (or photon) to a targeted state in a nonlinear dimer. We create a machine learning model containing two variables, chi(D) and chi(A), representing the nonlinear terms in the donor and acceptor target system states. We then introduce a data-free physics-informed loss function as 1.0 - P-j, where P-j is the probability, the electron being in the targeted state, j. By minimizing the loss function, we maximize the occupation probability to the targeted state. The method recovers known results in the targeted energy transfer (TET) model, and it is then applied to a more complex system with an additional intermediate state. In this trimer configuration, the PIML approach discovers desired resonant paths from the donor to acceptor units. The proposed PIML method is general and may be used in the chemical design of molecular complexes or engineering design of quantum or photonic systems. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America},

  abstract = {Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias-variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning practice. The bias-variance trade-off implies that a model should balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This "double-descent" curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias-variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine-learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses and has implications for both the theory and the practice of machine learning.},

Thus it is now important to establish a comparison of these electrolyte components in a standard solvent mixture of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate (EC/DMC: 50/50 wt\%). With this aim, transport properties, such as the ionic conductivity, viscosity and               7               Li self-diffusion coefficient have been deeply investigated. Moreover, as these properties are directly linked to the nature of the interionic interactions and ion solvation, a better understanding of the structural properties of electrolytes can be obtained. The Li salt concentration has been varied over the range of 0.1 mol L               -1               to 2 mol L               -1               at 25 \textdegree C and the working temperature from 20 \textdegree C to 80 \textdegree C at the fixed concentration of 1 mol L               -1               . Experimental results were used to investigate the temperature dependence of the salt ion-pair (IP) dissociation coefficient (               {$\alpha$}               D               ) with the help of the Walden rule and the Nernst\textendash Einstein equation. The lithium cation effective solute radius (               r               Li               ) has been determined using the Jones\textendash Dole\textendash Kaminsky equation coupled to the Einstein relation for the viscosity of hard spheres in solution and the Stokes\textendash Einstein equation. From the variations of               {$\alpha$}               D               and r               Li               with the temperature, it is inferred that in EC/DMC LiFSI forms solvent-shared ion-pairs (SIP) and that, LiTDI and LiPF               6               are likely to form solvent separated ion-pairs (S               2               IP) or a mixture of SIP and S               2               IP. From the temperature dependence of               {$\alpha$}               D               , thermodynamic parameters such as the standard Gibbs free energy, enthalpy and entropy for the ion-pair formation are obtained. Besides being in agreement with the information provided by the variations of               {$\alpha$}               D               and r               Li               , it is concluded that the ion-pair formation process is exergonic and endothermic for the three salts in EC/DMC.},

So a condition monitoring techniques are employed which embraces a knowledge of failure mechanism of individual part or integrated system, and diagnosis the health condition of a system in real time such that if it drifts from scheduled outcomes, an appropriate action to be taken before serious deterioration or breakdown occurs. The electronic system needs a fault prediction methodology to prevent the system from accidental failure and discrepancies. In this paper, different failure prediction methods have been discussed. For an efficient working of system, it is the prime requirement to analyze reliability prediction of electronic components along with life cycle costs.},

For each DNN, multiple performance indices are observed, such as recognition accuracy, model complexity, computational complexity, memory usage, and inference time. The behavior of such performance indices and some combinations of them are analyzed and discussed. To measure the indices, we experiment the use of DNNs on two different computer architectures, a workstation equipped with a NVIDIA Titan X Pascal, and an embedded system based on a NVIDIA Jetson TX1 board. This experimentation allows a direct comparison between DNNs running on machines with very different computational capacities. This paper is useful for researchers to have a complete view of what solutions have been explored so far and in which research directions are worth exploring in the future, and for practitioners to select the DNN architecture(s) that better fit the resource constraints of practical deployments and applications. To complete this work, all the DNNs, as well as the software used for the analysis, are available online.},

  abstract = {\DH Non-linear drift velocities have been reported when passing electrical currents through short metal lines. The aluminum drift velocity assumes very small values or disappears completely when metal lines are short. It was proposed that atoms moving by electromigration cause buildup of stress gradients (and in some cases concentration gradients) opposing their \textasciimacron ow. Below a critical length there is no \textasciimacron ow and above it, the drift velocity changes linearly with additional current. For aluminum lines with vertical grain boundaries it was suggested that the stress gradients are sucient for calculating the back \textasciimacron ow. By measuring the stress gradients in metal lines at or below the critical length, the value of the eective charge for aluminum was deduced. This value is quite low and does not agree with commonly accepted values. An original experiment is revisited, numerical calculations seem to substantiate the low value of the eective charge. Proposals for further experimentation are given. \# 1998 Acta Metallurgica Inc.},

  abstract = {Various biological processes such as transport of oxygen and nutrients, thrombus formation, vascular angiogenesis and remodeling are related to cellular/subcellular level biological processes, where mesoscopic simulations resolving detailed cell dynamics provide a key to understanding and identifying the cellular basis of disease. However, the intrinsic stochastic effects can play an important role in mesoscopic processes, while the time step allowed in a mesoscopic simulation is restricted by rapid cellular/subcellular dynamic processes. These challenges significantly limit the timescale that can be reached by mesoscopic simulations even with high-performance computing. To break this bottleneck and achieve a biologically meaningful timescale, we propose a multiscale parareal algorithm in which a continuum-based solver supervises a mesoscopic simulation in the time-domain. Using an iterative prediction-correction strategy, the parallel-in-time mesoscopic simulation supervised by its continuum-based counterpart can converge fast. The effectiveness of the proposed method is first verified in a time-dependent flow with a sinusoidal flowrate through a Y-shaped bifurcation channel. The results show that the supervised mesoscopic simulations of both Newtonian fluids and non-Newtonian bloods converge to reference solutions after a few iterations. Physical quantities of interest including velocity, wall shear stress and flowrate are computed to compare against those of reference solutions, showing a less than 1\% relative error on flowrate in the Newtonian flow and a less than 3\% relative error in the non-Newtonian blood flow. The proposed method is then applied to a large-scale mesoscopic simulation of microvessel blood flow in a zebrafish hindbrain for temporal acceleration. The three-dimensional geometry of the vasculature is constructed directly from the images of live zebrafish under a confocal microscope, resulting in a complex vascular network with 95 branches and 57 bifurcations. The time-dependent blood flow from heartbeats in this realistic vascular network of zebrafish hindbrain is simulated using dissipative particle dynamics as the mesoscopic model, which is supervised by a one-dimensional blood flow model (continuum-based model) in multiple temporal sub-domains. The computational analysis shows that the resulting microvessel blood flow converges to the reference solution after only two iterations. The proposed method is suitable for long-time mesoscopic simulations with complex fluids and geometries. It can be readily combined with classical spatial decomposition for further acceleration.},

The fundamental properties of the active absorber layers, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites formed from mixing metal and organic halides [e.g., (NH4)PbI3 and (CH3NH3)PbI3], are largely unknown. The materials are semiconductors with direct band gaps at the boundary of the first Brillouin zone. The calculated dielectric constants and band gaps show an orientation dependence, with a low barrier for rotation of the organic cations. Due to the electric dipole of the methylammonium cation, a photoferroic effect may be accessible, which could enhance carrier collection.},

  abstract = {Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

  abstract = {Tomographic background oriented Schlieren (Tomo-BOS) imaging measures density or temperature fields in three dimensions using multiple camera BOS projections, and is particularly useful for instantaneous flow visualizations of complex fluid dynamics problems. We propose a new method based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to infer the full continuous three-dimensional (3-D) velocity and pressure fields from snapshots of 3-D temperature fields obtained by Tomo-BOS imaging. The PINNs seamlessly integrate the underlying physics of the observed fluid flow and the visualization data, hence enabling the inference of latent quantities using limited experimental data. In this hidden fluid mechanics paradigm, we train the neural network by minimizing a loss function composed of a data mismatch term and residual terms associated with the coupled Navier-Stokes and heat transfer equations. We first quantify the accuracy of the proposed method based on a two-dimensional synthetic data set for buoyancy-driven flow, and subsequently apply it to the Tomo-BOS data set, where we are able to infer the instantaneous velocity and pressure fields of the flow over an espresso cup based only on the temperature field provided by the Tomo-BOS imaging. Moreover, we conduct an independent PIV experiment to validate the PINN inference for the unsteady velocity field at a centre plane. To explain the observed flow physics, we also perform systematic PINN simulations at different Reynolds and Richardson numbers and quantify the variations in velocity and pressure fields. The results in this paper indicate that the proposed deep learning technique can become a promising direction in experimental fluid mechanics.},

The PhaseDNN makes use of the fact that common deep neural networks (DNNs) often achieve convergence in the low frequency range first, and constructs a series of moderately sized DNNs trained for selected high frequency ranges. With the help of phase shifts in the frequency domain, each of the DNNs will be trained to approximate the function's specific high frequency range at the speed of learning for low frequency. As a result, the proposed PhaseDNN is able to convert high frequency learning to low frequency learning, allowing a uniform learning of wideband functions. The PhaseDNN is then applied to learn solutions of high frequency wave problems in inhomogeneous media through the least squares residual of either differential or integral equations. Numerical results have demonstrated the capability of the PhaseDNN as a meshless method in general domains in learning high frequency functions and oscillatory solutions of interior and exterior Helmholtz problems.},

  abstract = {The lithium metal anode is one of the key components of the lithium\textendash sulfur (Li\textendash S) batteries, which are considered one of the most promising candidates for the next generation of battery systems.           ,                             The lithium metal anode is one of the key components of the lithium\textendash sulfur (Li\textendash S) batteries, which are considered one of the most promising candidates for the next generation of battery systems. However, one of the main challenges that have prevented Li-metal anodes from becoming feasible to be used in commercial batteries is the continuous decomposition of the electrolyte due to its high reactivity, which leads to the formation of solid\textendash electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. The properties of the SEI can dramatically affect the performance of the batteries. Thus, a rigorous understanding of the electrolyte decomposition is crucial to elucidate improvements in performance of the Li\textendash S technology. In this work, using density functional theory (DFT) and               ab initio               molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD), we investigate the effect of electron-rich environments on the decomposition mechanism of electrolyte species in pure 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) solvent and 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) salt solutions. It is found that systems with pure DME require an average environment of at least {$\sim$}0.9 |               e               | per molecule for a DME to decompose into CH               3               O               -               and C               2               H               4               2-               via               a 4-electron transfer. In the case of mixtures, the salts are very prone to react with any excess of electrons. In addition, DME dehydrogenation due to reactions with fragments coming from the salt decompositions was detected. Formation of oligomer anionic species from DME and salt fragments were also identified from the AIMD simulations. Finally, the thermodynamics and kinetics of the most relevant electrolyte decomposition reactions were characterized. DME decomposition reactions predicted from the AIMD simulations were found to be thermodynamically favorable under exposure to Li atoms and/or by reactions with salt fragments. In most cases, these reactions were shown to have low to moderate activation barriers.},

  abstract = {Due to their high energy density and reduced cost, lithium-sulfur batteries are promising alternatives for applications such as electrical vehicles. However, a number of technical challenges need to be overcome in order to make them feasible for commercial uses. These challenges arise from the battery highly interconnected chemistry, which besides the electrochemical reactions includes side reactions at both electrodes and migration of soluble polysulfide (PS) species produced at the cathode to the anode side. The presence of such PS species alters the already complex reactivity of the Li anode. In this work, interfacial reactions occurring at the surface of Li metal anodes due to electrochemical instability of the electrolyte components and PS species are investigated with density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics methods. It is found that the bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt reacts very fast when in contact with the Li surface, and anion decomposition precedes salt dissociation. The anion decomposition mechanisms are fully elucidated. Two of the typical solvents used in Li-S technology, 1,3-dioxolane and 1,2dimethoxyethane, are found stable during the entire simulation length, in contrast with the case of ethylene carbonate that is rapidly decomposed by sequential 2- or 4-electron mechanisms. On the other hand, the fast reactivity of the soluble PS species alters the side reactions because the PS totally decomposes before any of the electrolyte components forming Li2S on the anode surface.},

The canary is composed of a resistance path formed by a near-zero ohm ceramic chip resistor soldered to pads designed to produce failure earlier than standard pad resistors, which are the target structures. The time to failure of the canary can be adjusted by adjusting the printed wiring board pad dimensions and, hence, the solder interconnect area. The developed canary approach is demonstrated through temperature cycling of the resistors. The pad width of a standard resistor is reduced by 80\%, thereby reducing the interconnect life. The results from the temperature cycling experiment prove that the developed canary approach provides advanced warning of failures of the standard pad resistors.

The Engelmaiermodel, a physics-of-failure-based model for solder interconnect life estimation under thermal cycling, is modified to take the solder interconnect area into account.

Unfortunately, the growth of lithium dendrites during recharging hinders the practical application of Li metal anodes. Herein, we report a new biomimetic ionogel electrolyte with ant-nest architecture by the confinement of an ionic liquid within a chemically modified SiO               2               scaffold for promoting the dendrite-free stripping/plating of Li anodes. The biomimetic ant-nest architecture not only has high ionic conductivity, but can also effectively restrain the Li dendrite growth by the spontaneous formation of a particle-rich protective layer on the lithium electrode during charge/discharge cycling.

  abstract = {Lithium (Li) and sodium (Na) metal batteries are considered as promising next-generation energy storage devices due to their ultrahigh energy densities. However, the high reactivity of alkali metal toward organic solvents and salts renders inevitable side reactions, which further leads to undesirable electrolyte depletion, cell failure, and evolution of flammable gas. In this work, first-principles calculations, in combination with in situ optical microscopic observations, are employed to unveil the mechanism of organic electrolyte decomposition and gas evolution on Na metal anode. Once complexed with Na ions, solvent molecules exhibit a significantly reduced the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level, facilitating the electrolyte decomposition and gas evolution. Such a general mechanism is also applicable to Li and other metal anodes. This work uncovers the critical role of ion-solvent complexation in stability of alkali metal anodes, reveals the nature of electrolyte gassing, and provides a mechanistic guidance to electrolyte and Li/Na anode design for safe rechargeable batteries.},

  abstract = {军舰民船等在实海中执行防护任务开展运输作业,海水环境中种类繁多的微生物附着在其表面代谢增殖形成生物膜。多种微生物协同作用影响船体结构材料的腐蚀过程,导致材料腐蚀的加剧或抑制。研究多种微生物协同作用下船体结构材料的腐蚀过程,对于揭示腐蚀机理、提供腐蚀防护指导都有十分重要的理论和实际意义。本论文以船体结构材料907钢为研究对象,先后进行了实海挂片实验、实验室模拟实海实验、单种微生物以及好氧与厌氧微生物协同作用下的腐蚀实验。采用涂布分离培养法和宏基因组高通量测序技术分离、提纯、培养并鉴定腐蚀微生物,研究其微生物群落丰富度、多样性和组成结构信息。采用丝束电极技术和电化学阻抗方法研究腐蚀电化学行为,采用扫描电子显微镜、X-射线光电子能谱、X-射线衍射观察腐蚀形貌、分析腐蚀产物组成,采用激光共聚焦显微镜和荧光显微镜观察生物膜形成和分布,监测体系DO和pH等环境参数的变化。综合以上结果归纳腐蚀特点、解析腐蚀机制,主要的研究内容如下:(1)探讨了海域、腐蚀区带、暴露时间等因素对907钢的腐蚀影响。结果表明,同一海域相同腐蚀区带浸泡6个月试样腐蚀速率高于浸泡3个月试样;同一海域相同浸泡时间潮差区腐蚀速率大于全浸区;相同腐蚀区带相同浸泡时间三亚海域腐蚀速率大于青岛海域。907钢实海挂片腐蚀产物组成变化不大主要为Fe\_3O\_4、?-FeOOH、?-FeOOH等,另外CaCO\_3混杂附着在腐蚀产物中并可不断积累。多种微生物实海共存,三亚海域分离得到可培养微生物种类高于青岛海域,SRB普遍存在于不同海域全浸区各实验时长907钢腐蚀产物中,受时空条件影响,微生物分离结果不同且分布随条件改变发生变化。(2)探讨了实海环境下907钢腐蚀产物层中微生物群落结构的多样性。结果发现,在青岛海域全浸区挂片3个月907钢的腐蚀速率约为0.23 mm/a,腐蚀产物主要为{$\alpha$}-FeOOH、{$\gamma$}-FeOOH、{$\gamma$}-Fe\_2O\_3和Fe\_3O\_4,腐蚀形式为均匀腐蚀。腐蚀产物内层微生物群落的丰富度和多样性均高于外层样品。内外层腐蚀产物OTU数分别为1763和1691,共有OTU数为941。内外层SRB的OTU数目分别为908和798,其中共有OTU数目为438。内外层样品在属水平的共有群落主要为贪铜菌、鞘氨醇单胞菌、乳杆菌和苍白杆菌。内外层共有SRB在属水平菌群主要为脱硫弧菌、脱硫杆菌、色菌。(3)构建实海模拟体系,研究了微生物对907钢腐蚀行为的影响。微生物使得907钢的腐蚀速率略有降低,由约0.0727 mm{$\cdot$}a\textasciitilde (-1)降低到约0.0615 mm{$\cdot$}a\textasciitilde (-1)。微生物改变了腐蚀形貌与腐蚀产物组成,无菌体系针片状腐蚀产物尺寸逐渐增大并堆叠成簇覆盖样品表面,腐蚀产物为Fe\_3O\_4、FeCO\_3和FeOOH;有菌体系微生物与代谢产物不均匀分散于样品表面形成生物膜,腐蚀产物为FeS和Fe\_3O\_4。微生物代谢类型、生物膜形成发展以及代谢产物性质综合影响腐蚀过程。微生物的好氧代谢抑制氧在阴极的去极化反应、降低反应速率。生物膜在实验初期形成阻碍电荷传递转移、实验后期破损导致腐蚀抑制作用弱化。微生物生命活动积累的有机酸使溶液pH降低,对腐蚀有促进作用。实验后期SRB的生长代谢亦能促进腐蚀。各因素综合影响,腐蚀抑制作用强于腐蚀促进作用。(4)揭示了脱硫弧菌对907钢腐蚀过程的影响与作用机制。研究发现,在无氧海水培养基条件下907钢的腐蚀速率与脱硫弧菌生长曲线变化趋势一致。脱硫弧菌代谢形成不均匀生物膜,去除腐蚀产物后局部出现孔蚀,FeS为主要的腐蚀产物。脱硫弧菌对907钢腐蚀机制的影响可能源于代谢产物H\_2S阴极去极化作用对局部微观电化学性质的改变。无菌介质中,i\_(max)数值持续减小腐蚀没有深入发展。活性阳极位点位置不固定导致大面积阳极区形成并发生均匀腐蚀。脱硫弧菌介质中,电化学活性位点生成后保持稳定最终形成大阴极小阳极的特征电流分布促进阴极去极化作用促进局部孔蚀的形成和发展。(5)构建脱硫弧菌和溶藻弧菌共同作用下的实验体系,研究两种微生物对907钢的腐蚀行为及腐蚀机理的共同影响。研究发现,海水条件脱硫弧菌和溶藻弧菌共同作用改变907钢的腐蚀速率、腐蚀类型、产物成分和腐蚀程度。无菌体系腐蚀速率约为0.2 mg{$\cdot$}cm\textasciitilde (-2){$\cdot$}d\textasciitilde (-1),发生均匀腐蚀且程度较深,腐蚀产物主要为FeOOH、Fe\_3O\_4和FeCO\_3。混合菌体系腐蚀速率约为0.07 mg{$\cdot$}cm\textasciitilde (-2){$\cdot$}d\textasciitilde (-1),发生程度较轻的局部腐蚀且腐蚀产物中出现FeS。溶藻弧菌消耗海水中溶解氧代谢生成生物膜抑制腐蚀的深入发生并且创造脱硫弧菌生存所需的无氧微环境。脱硫弧菌的生命活动改变了生物膜的结构和形态,但其对腐蚀的促进作用未占主导地位。},

  abstract = {{$\blacksquare$} Abstract\hspace{0.6em} The phase-field method has recently emerged as a powerful computational approach to modeling and predicting mesoscale morphological and microstructure evolution in materials. It describes a microstructure using a set of conserved and nonconserved field variables that are continuous across the interfacial regions. The temporal and spatial evolution of the field variables is governed by the Cahn-Hilliard nonlinear diffusion equation and the Allen-Cahn relaxation equation. With the fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic information as the input, the phase-field method is able to predict the evolution of arbitrary morphologies and complex microstructures without explicitly tracking the positions of interfaces. This paper briefly reviews the recent advances in developing phase-field models for various materials processes including solidification, solid-state structural phase transformations, grain growth and coarsening, domain evolution in thin films, pattern formation on surfaces, dislocation microstructures, crack propagation, and electromigration.},

  abstract = {A reduced basis method based on a physics-informed machine learning framework is developed for efficient reduced-order modeling of parametrized partial differential equations (PDEs). A feedforward neural network is used to approximate the mapping from the time-parameter to the reduced coefficients. During the offline stage, the network is trained by minimizing the weighted sum of the residual loss of the reduced-order equations, and the data loss of the labeled reduced coefficients that are obtained via the projection of high-fidelity snapshots onto the reduced space. Such a network is referred to as physics-reinforced neural network (PRNN). As the number of residual points in time-parameter space can be very large, an accurate network - referred to as physics-informed neural network (PINN) - can be trained by minimizing only the residual loss. However, for complex nonlinear problems, the solution of the reduced-order equation is less accurate than the projection of high-fidelity solution onto the reduced space. Therefore, the PRNN trained with the snapshot data is expected to have higher accuracy than the PINN. Numerical results demonstrate that the PRNN is more accurate than the PINN and a purely data-driven neural network for complex problems. During the reduced basis refinement, the PRNN may obtain higher accuracy than the direct reduced-order model based on a Galerkin projection. The online evaluation of PINN/PRNN is orders of magnitude faster than that of the Galerkin reduced-order model. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {随着国家蓝色海洋战略的启动及海洋经济的迅速发展,人类逐步走向海洋深处,开发利用海洋中丰富的的矿产资源、生物资源及能源资源等。然而,海洋中多种多样的生物在船底、海洋平台等水下结构物表面的粘附及其所带来的一系列问题长期困扰着人类。目前涂覆防污涂层是抑制海生物附着最为经济有效的手段之一。本文以环境友好型自抛光防污涂层为研究对象,通过自由基聚合及原子转移自由基聚合两种方法先后制备交联型丙烯酸锌树脂、丙烯酸锌硅共聚树脂及丙烯酸硅烷树脂等丙烯酸酯类可水解型防污树脂,通过对树脂可水解单体结构和含量的调控,使自抛光防污涂层实现树脂可控水解、涂层稳定磨蚀以及长期有效的防污效果。主要研究内容如下:采用两步法将自制双官能度丙烯酸锌单体与其他丙烯酸酯类单体共聚得到无规共聚交联型丙烯酸锌树脂,并将其制成自抛光防污涂料。对树脂结构进行红外、核磁表征、热分析以及涂料稳定性等测试,结果表明合成具有Zn-O键结构、储存稳定性良好的交联型丙烯酸锌防污树脂及防污涂料。利用自制动态模拟实验装置初步评价防污涂料的磨蚀性能,表明自抛光涂料的磨蚀性能不仅与可水解树脂有关,同时也与涂料配方中的其它组分有关,且丙烯酸锌单体含量越高,涂层磨蚀速率越快。其中,含有20\%锌单体的交联型丙烯酸锌树脂与含铜防污剂复配制备的含铜防污涂料,可以实现南海9个月,黄海海域至少15个月的静态实海防污效果;含有16\%锌单体的交联型丙烯酸锌树脂与各种无铜防污剂复配制备的多种无铜防污涂料,可在新加坡海域实现至少9个月的静态防污效果。以自制丙烯酸锌单体及丙烯酸三异丙基硅烷酯为水解单体,以甲基丙烯酸甲酯和丙烯酸乙酯为共聚单体进行共聚反应合成丙烯酸锌硅共聚树脂,通过调控水解单体的比例来改善丙烯酸硅烷树脂基涂层的静态防污性能。静态水解失重实验表明丙烯酸锌硅共聚树脂中丙烯酸锌单体含量越高,共聚树脂的的水解速率越快。硅藻三角褐指藻的抑制及附着试验表明随着丙烯酸锌单体含量的增加,树脂对三角褐指藻的生长抑制作用更明显。实海挂板实验表明丙烯酸锌硅共聚树脂与含铜防污剂复配制备的含铜自抛光防污涂料可在黄海海域实现至少15个月的静态防污效果。利用原子转移活性聚合方法,以2-溴代异丁酰溴为引发剂,溴化亚铜与联二吡啶为催化体系,以丙烯酸三异丙基硅烷酯、甲基丙烯酸甲酯、2-甲烷氧基乙基丙烯酸酯为单体进行了共聚反应,得到分子量分布较窄的丙烯酸硅烷无规共聚树脂。丙烯酸硅烷树脂对大肠杆菌及金色葡萄球杆菌的生长没有影响,对小新月菱形藻有抑制附着的作用。对交联型丙烯酸锌树脂基含铜及无铜的防污涂料进行了实船试验,至少具有一年的实海防污效果。},

  abstract = {Lithium (Li) metal battery is strongly considered as one of the potential candidates for next-generation energy storage devices due to its ultrahigh energy density. However, gas evolution induced by spontaneous decomposition of organic electrolytes during cell cycling leads to the capacity decay and safety issues of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, the gas evolution behavior in a working Li-sulfur (Li-S) battery based on the most widely used 1,3-dioxolane (DOL)/1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) electrolyte was probed through gas phase chromatography, mass spectrum of as-produced gas in pouch cells, as well as the first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics. An adsorption-to-reaction mechanism that DOL/DME firstly adsorbed lithium and then decomposed was proposed and verified. DOL with a small decomposition barrier was found to be easily decomposed into ethylene. When the DME:DOL ratio in the organic of Li-S cell was increased, a high and long discharge plateau as well as a large discharge capacity were observed. We also protected Li metal anode to avoid the direct contact between electrolyte and fresh Li metal through the polysulfide additives. The asobtained cell afforded few gas evolution and consequently a long cycling life. This understanding sheds fresh light of ultra-long cycling life of Li-S pouch cell from the viewpoint of stable electrolyte based on theoretical predictions and experimental verifications, which can be extended to other LMBs based on multi-electron redox reactions.},

Optical absorption and structural analysis of CH3NH3SnX3 thin films are combined with ab initio calculations in order to clarify their electronic properties and the role of the organic cation. The structural calculations reproduce well the measured lattice parameters, and optical measurements reveal a direct gap absorption onset for both compounds, in agreement with the calculated band structures. It turns out from projected density of states analysis that the valence and conduction bands take negligible contribution from the methylammonium. It is inferred that the band gap mainly depends on the ionicity and size of the inorganic cage SnX3.},

In this Review, we present a critical overview of a wide range of post-LIB materials and systems that could have a pivotal role in meeting such demands. We divide battery systems into two categories: near-term and long-term technologies. To provide a realistic and balanced perspective, we describe the operating principles and remaining issues of each post-LIB technology, and also evaluate these materials under commercial cell configurations.},

These assumptions enable us to explain the complexity of the fully decoupled neural network through the prism of the results from random matrix theory. We show that for large-size decoupled networks the lowest critical values of the random loss function form a layered structure and they are located in a well-defined band lower-bounded by the global minimum. The number of local minima outside that band diminishes exponentially with the size of the network. We empirically verify that the mathematical model exhibits similar behavior as the computer simulations, despite the presence of high dependencies in real networks. We conjecture that both simulated annealing and SGD converge to the band of low critical points, and that all critical points found there are local minima of high quality measured by the test error. This emphasizes a major difference between large-and small-size networks where for the latter poor quality local minima have nonzero probability of being recovered. Finally, we prove that recovering the global minimum becomes harder as the network size increases and that it is in practice irrelevant as global minimum often leads to overfitting.},

  abstract = {Deep learning (DL) has become an essential tool in prognosis and health management (PHM), commonly used as a regression algorithm for the prognosis of a system's behavior. One particular metric of interest is the remaining useful life (RUL) estimated using monitoring sensor data. Most of these deep learning applications treat the algorithms as black-box functions, giving little to no control of the data interpretation. This becomes an issue if the models break the governing laws of physics or other natural sciences when no constraints are imposed. The latest research efforts have focused on applying complex DL models to achieve a low prediction error rather than studying how the models interpret the behavior of the data and the system itself. In this paper, we propose an open-box approach using a deep neural network framework to explore the physics of degradation through partial differential equations (PDEs). The framework has three stages, and it aims to discover a latent variable and corresponding PDE to represent the health state of the system. Models are trained as a supervised regression and designed to output the RUL as well as a latent variable map that can be used and interpreted as the system's health indicator.},

Equivariant networks have shown excellent performance and data efficiency on vision and medical imaging problems that exhibit symmetries. Here we show how this principle can be extended beyond global symmetries to local gauge transformations. This enables the development of a very general class of convolutional neural networks on manifolds that depend only on the intrinsic geometry, and which includes many popular methods from equivariant and geometric deep learning. We implement gauge equivariant CNNs for signals defined on the surface of the icosahedron, which provides a reasonable approximation of the sphere. By choosing to work with this very regular manifold, we are able to implement the gauge equivariant convolution using a single conv2d call, making it a highly scalable and practical alternative to Spherical CNNs. Using this method, we demonstrate substantial improvements over previous methods on the task of segmenting omnidirectional images and global climate patterns.},

To be specific, we prove that under certain assumptions, the two neural network architectures we proposed represent viscosity solutions to two sets of HJ PDEs with zero error. We also implement our proposed neural network architectures using Tensorflow and provide several examples and illustrations. Note that these neural network representations can avoid curve of dimensionality for certain HJ PDEs, since they do not involve neither grids nor discretization. Our results suggest that efficient dedicated hardware implementation for neural networks can be leveraged to evaluate viscosity solutions of certain HJ PDEs. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

It shows the superharmonic behavior of the proton motion, which is strongly coupled to the donor-acceptor stretching and disappears on H-bond bending. In combination with high-level quantum-chemical calculations, we demonstrate a distinct crossover in spectroscopic properties from conventional to short strong H-bonds, which identify where hydrogen bonding ends and chemical bonding begins.},

  abstract = {We present a simple and effective method for representing periodic functions and enforcing exactly the periodic boundary conditions for solving differential equations with deep neural networks (DNN). The method stems from some simple properties about function compositions involving periodic functions. It essentially composes a DNN-represented arbitrary function with a set of independent periodic functions with adjustable (training) parameters. We distinguish two types of periodic conditions: those imposing the periodicity requirement on the function and all its derivatives (to infinite order), and those imposing periodicity on the function and its derivatives up to a finite order k(k {$>$}= 0). The former will be referred to as C-infinity periodic conditions, and the latter C-k periodic conditions. We define operations that constitute a C-infinity periodic layer and a C-k periodic layer (for any k {$>$}= 0). A deep neural network with a C-infinity (or C-k) periodic layer incorporated as the second layer automatically and exactly satisfies the C-infinity (or C-k) periodic conditions. We present extensive numerical experiments on ordinary and partial differential equations with C-infinity and C-k periodic boundary conditions to verify and demonstrate that the proposed method indeed enforces exactly, to the machine accuracy, the periodicity for the DNN solution and its derivatives.

  abstract = {Abstract             We present a physics-informed neural network modeling approach for missing physics estimation in cumulative damage models. This hybrid approach is designed to merge physics-informed and data-driven layers within deep neural networks. The result is a cumulative damage model in which physics-informed layers are used to model relatively well understood phenomena and data-driven layers account for hard-to-model physics. A numerical experiment is used to present the main features of the proposed framework. The test problem consists of predicting corrosion-fatigue of an Al 2024-T3 alloy used on panels of aircraft wings. Besides cyclic loading, panels are also subjected to saline corrosion. In this case, physics-informed layers implement the well-known Walker model for crack propagation, while data-driven layers are trained to compensate the bias in damage accumulation due to the corrosion effects. The physics-informed neural network is trained using full observation of inputs (far-field loads, stress ratio, and a corrosivity index defined per airport) and very limited observation of outputs (crack length at inspection for only a small portion of the fleet). Results show that the physics-informed neural network is able to learn how to compensate the missing physics of corrosion in the original fatigue model. Predictions from the hybrid model can be used in fleet management, for example, to prioritize inspection across the fleet or forecast ahead of time the number of planes with damage above a threshold.},

Supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA) data of WT is adopted and several parameters are selected based on physical knowledge in this domain and correlation coefficient analysis to build a normal behavior model. This model which is based on Self-organizing map (SOM) projects higher-dimensional SCADA data into a two-dimension-map. Afterwards, the Euclidean distance based indicator for system level anomalies is defined and a filter is created to screen out suspicious data points based on quantile function. Moreover, a failure data pattern based criterion is created for anomaly detection from system level. In order to track which sub-component should be responsible for an anomaly, a contribution proportion (CP) index is proposed. The method is tested with a two-month SCADA dataset with the measurement interval as 20 seconds. Results demonstrate capability and efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Measurements have been made of the electrolytic growth on silver spheres of dendrites from the silver + silver nitrate system in liquid sodium nitrate + potassium nitrate. The potential and current density for initiation have been determined as a function of concentration and purity of the solution. Rates of growth have been measured as a function of potential at constant overpotential. The radius of the tips has been determined by electron microscopy. At constant current, the current density on to the base electrode during dendritic growth is proportional to the overpotential and the slope of the current density-overpotential relation is proportional to the concentration of silver ions. A critical current density (               i               crit               ) exists for initiation of dendritic growth. It is proportional to the silver ion concentration and increases as the radius of the substrate electrode decreases.               i               crit               corresponds to an overpotential of 3 mV and increases with increasing purity of the solution. Dendrites are initiated up to 1 h after a constant current is switched on. At a given overpotential, a number of dendrites grow at a characteristic rate (               v               ). Dendrites initiated at higher potential grow faster than those initiated at lower potential. The growing tip is parabolic and               r               tip {$\bumpeq$} 10               -5               cm. Twins are in some dendrites. The current density to the substrate is controlled by diffusion at all conditions and obeys laws characteristic of spherical diffusion for small radii of the substrate. The rate of growth of the dendrites is controlled by the kinetics of the Ag               +               ion deposition on the dendrite tip (activation and (spherical) diffusion control) and the effect on the Ag               +               +               e               {$\rightleftharpoons$} Ag reaction of the tip radius. For low exchange currents (               i               0               )               v               {$\propto$} {$\eta$}: for high i               0               ,               v               {$\alpha$} {$\eta$}               2               . The calculated rate of growth agrees with experimental data on maximum growth rate to some 50 \%. The calculated               r               tip               for maximum growth is essentially in agreement with that observed. At I{$\eta$}I {$<$} 3mV, the theoretical               r               tip               for maximum growth rate increases rapidly, and an alternative electrode process succeeds that of dendritic growth. The theory shows that the optimum radius for growth undergoes a rapid increase in the neighbourhood of the critical overpotential for cessation of growth. Dendrites are initiated only after a preliminary prismatic growth passes through the diffusion layer characteristic of the substrate electrode. Not all prismatic protrusions from the substrate are growth sites. Conditions for the stability of the tip shape during growth are deduced. Dendrites which grow with               v               less than               v               max               are those with a stable               r               less than               r               opt               . It is a good approximation to apply equations for diffusion to a stationary surface for the moving dendrite tip. The model is consistent with an observed increase in the number of dendrites with potential and with aspects of side-arm growth.},

  abstract = {This work studies the underlying nature of H-bonds (HBs) of different types and strengths and tries to predict binding energies (BEs) based on the properties derived from wave function analysis. A total of 42 HB complexes constructed from 28 neutral and 14 charged monomers were considered. This set was designed to sample a wide range of HB strengths to obtain a complete view about HBs. BEs were derived with the accurate coupled cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples correction (CCSD(T))(T) method and the physical components of the BE were investigated by symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT). Quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules (QTAIM) descriptors and other HB indices were calculated based on high-quality density functional theory wave functions. We propose a new and rigorous classification of H-bonds (HBs) based on the SAPT decomposition. Neutral complexes are either classified as ``very weak'' HBs with a BE {$\geq$} -2.5 kcal/mol that are mainly dominated by both dispersion and electrostatic interactions or as ``weak-to-medium'' HBs with a BE varying between -2.5 and -14.0 kcal/mol that are only dominated by electrostatic interactions. On the other hand, charged complexes are divided into ``medium'' HBs with a BE in the range of -11.0 to -15.0 kcal/mol, which are mainly dominated by electrostatic interactions, or into ``strong'' HBs whose BE is more negative than -15.0 kcal/mol, which are mainly dominated by electrostatic together with induction interactions. Among various explored correlations between BEs and wave function-based HB descriptors, a fairly satisfactory correlation was found for the electron density at the bond critical point (BCP; {$\rho$}BCP) of HBs. The fitted equation for neutral complexes is BE/kcal/mol = - 223.08 \texttimes{} {$\rho$}BCP/a. u. + 0.7423 with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 14.7\%, while that for charged complexes is BE/kcal/mol = - 332.34 \texttimes{} {$\rho$}BCP/a. u. - 1.0661 with a MAPE of 10.0\%. In practice, these equations may be used for a quick estimation of HB BEs, for example, for intramolecular HBs or large HB networks in biomolecules. \textcopyright{} 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This constitutes a potential paradigm shift in conducting experimental research, where robots, computers, and humans collaborate to accelerate discovery and to search expeditiously and effectively large parametric spaces that are impracticable with the traditional approach of sequential hypothesis testing and subsequent train-and-error execution. We describe how our research parallels efforts in other fields, providing an orders-of-magnitude reduction in the number of experiments required to explore and map the complex hydrodynamic mechanisms governing the fluid-elastic instabilities and resulting nonlinear VIV responses. We show the effectiveness of the methodology of "explore-and-exploit" in parametric spaces of high dimensions, which are intractable with traditional approaches of systematic parametric variation in experimentation. We envision that this active learning approach to experimental research can be used across disciplines and potentially lead to physical insights and a new generation of models in multi-input/multi-output nonlinear systems.},

  year = {2015},
  abstract = {钢筋锈蚀是造成混凝土结构提前失效的最主要原因之一,钢筋锈蚀的防护和修复也一直是钢筋混凝土耐久性的研究重点。在众多钢筋腐蚀的防护技术中,电化学除盐和使用迁移性阻锈剂被认为是两种较有效、实用的钢筋混凝土阻锈方法,但由于其本身的缺点和局限性,存在着某些方面的不足,如电化学除盐后钢筋自腐蚀电位负移,在侵蚀环境作用下易发生``二次腐蚀'';迁移性阻锈剂很难完全到达钢筋表面,对钢筋进行有效保护。本课题提出电迁移性阻锈剂的方法,在电化学除盐过程中使阻锈剂有效迁移至钢筋表面,在对锈蚀钢筋表面混凝土层进行脱盐、提高碱度的同时,使阻锈剂快速迁移进入混凝土并包裹在钢筋表面,形成对钢筋的多重防护,有效地提高钢筋的保护效率,并缩短修复时间和降低成本。本文围绕电迁移性阻锈剂的分子结构设计、合成及其在钢筋混凝土中的作用过程和机理等问题展开了系统研究,主要包括:基于电场作用下的迁移速率和对钢筋的阻锈效果,对阻锈剂的分子结构进行功能性设计,成功研发了一系列电迁移性阻锈剂;在此基础上,阐明了电迁移性阻锈剂的分子结构与其对钢筋的阻锈效果、在混凝土中的迁移动力学之间的构效关系,揭示了电迁移性阻锈剂对钢筋的防蚀机理和对混凝土组成、结构与性能影响的作用机制。具体研究工作包括:(1)根据电场作用下对外加剂的快速迁移和有效阻锈的技术要求,提出以咪唑啉为主要阻锈基团,并将其进行阳离子化的思路;以不同分子量的脂肪酸为原料,合成了在碱性环境中能溶于水、电离产生阳离子阻锈功能基团的系列咪唑啉季铵盐(IQS);研究了合成过程中各种因素对合成产物种类及产率的影响,获得了各种咪唑啉季铵盐较适宜的合成工艺条件,其合成产率可达90\%以上。(2)研究了咪唑啉季铵盐在含3.5\%氯化钠的混凝土模拟孔溶液中对钢筋的阻锈作用及机理。咪唑啉季铵盐对钢筋具有较好阻锈效果,并存在一个较佳掺量:当掺量为1.0\%时,其阻锈效果显著优于掺量为2.0\%醇胺类有机阻锈剂。咪唑啉季铵盐分子中咪唑啉杂环上1N与4N原子的电荷密度最大,是阻锈剂与钢筋表面铁原子键合的吸附中心,其电荷密度直接决定阻锈剂对钢筋的阻锈效果。因此,咪唑啉杂环数越多、碳支链长度越大,其对钢筋的阻锈效果越好。此外,咪唑啉季铵盐在溶液中的浓度超过其溶解度时,易形成胶束结构,从而产生``团聚与絮凝''现象而导致其阻锈效果降低。(3)研究了电场作用下,咪唑啉季铵盐在混凝土中的迁移动力学过程。咪唑啉季铵盐在混凝土中具有较快的迁移速度,且能在钢筋表面富集,电迁移处理28 d后,咪唑啉季铵盐在混凝土/钢筋界面处浆体中的最大浓度可达1.2 mg/g。咪唑啉季铵盐在混凝土中的迁移速度与电场驱动力和阻锈剂的分子结构有关:电场驱动力越大,阻锈剂分子荷电量越大,分子量越小,阻锈剂在混凝土中的迁移速度越快。(4)基于Nernst-Planck方程,建立了电场作用下混凝土内部的多离子迁移数学模型,模拟了混凝土中IQS、Cl-、Na+与K+等离子的迁移动力学过程。理论计算和实测混凝土内各离子的浓度分布基本一致,在实际工程中,可根据混凝土的性能和结构参数,对该模型的边界条件进行修订,用于定量分析阻锈剂电迁移过程中IQS、Cl-、Na+与K+等离子在混凝土内的分布,以确定合适的阻锈剂电迁移处理的技术参数,指导其在工程中的实际应用。(5)研究了咪唑啉季铵盐的电迁移对钢筋混凝土组成、结构与性能的影响。阻锈剂的电迁移使混凝土中部分水化产物(AFt,C-S-H)分解,Ca(OH)2含量显著增加。此外,由于阻锈剂的``孔隙堵塞''效应,混凝土的孔结构发生变化:外层混凝土的总孔隙率显著减少,但最可几孔径增大;内层混凝土的总孔隙率增大,最可几孔径减小。咪唑啉季铵盐的电迁移后,混凝土的抗渗性较电化学除盐有较大改善,能够减轻电化学除盐导致的混凝土抗渗性过度劣化的问题。(6)揭示了电迁移性阻锈剂对混凝土中钢筋的防蚀机理。咪唑啉季铵盐的电迁移过程对钢筋的腐蚀防护作用是通过以下作用共同实现的:(a)阻锈剂高效迁移至钢筋表面,并进行有效吸附与包裹;(b)混凝土内Cl-在电场作用下的排出;(c)钢筋周围碱性明显增强。咪唑啉季铵盐对钢筋的包裹有效防止了电化学除盐后钢筋可能发生的``二次腐蚀'',增强了混凝土结构后续抗侵蚀能力。},

  abstract = {The performance of organometallic perovskite solar cells has rapidly surpassed that of both conventional dye-sensitized and organic photovoltaics. High-power conversion efficiency can be realized in both mesoporous and thin-film device architectures. We address the origin of this success in the context of the materials chemistry and physics of the bulk perovskite as described by electronic structure calculations. In addition to the basic optoelectronic properties essential for an efficient photovoltaic device (spectrally suitable band gap, high optical absorption, low carrier effective masses), the materials are structurally and compositionally flexible. As we show, hybrid perovskites exhibit spontaneous electric polarization; we also suggest ways in which this can be tuned through judicious choice of the organic cation. The presence of ferroelectric domains will result in internal junctions that may aid separation of photoexcited electron and hole pairs, and reduction of recombination through segregation of charge carriers. The combination of high dielectric constant and low effective mass promotes both Wannier-Mott exciton separation and effective ionization of donor and acceptor defects. The photoferroic effect could be exploited in nanostructured films to generate a higher open circuit voltage and may contribute to the current\textendash voltage hysteresis observed in perovskite solar cells.},

However, their application in a nonlinear framework can be limited by high computational costs, numerical difficulties, and/or inaccuracies. In this pa-per, a hybrid methodology is presented which combines classical constitutive laws (model -based), a data-driven correction component, and computational multiscale approaches. A model-based material representation is locally improved with data from lower scales ob-tained by means of a nonlinear numerical homogenization procedure, leading to a model -data-driven approach. Therefore, macroscale simulations explicitly incorporate the true mi-croscale response, maintaining the same level of accuracy that would be obtained with online micro-macro simulations but with a computational cost comparable to classical model-driven approaches. In the proposed approach, both model and data play a funda-mental role allowing for the synergistic integration between a physics-based response and a machine learning black-box. Numerical applications are implemented in two dimensions for different tests investigating both material and structural responses in large deforma-tions. Overall, the presented model-data-driven methodology proves to be more versatile and accurate than methods based on classical model-driven, as well as pure data-driven techniques. In particular, a lower number of training samples is required and robustness is higher than for simulations which solely rely on data. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs - extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

  abstract = {随着工艺节点的不断进步,电迁移效应已成为影响集成电路互连线可靠性最重要的问题之一。集成电路版图中,由于电源地互连线网络长时间承载单一方向的大电流,这会在互连线末端产生应力堆积,所以电源地互连线网络跟信号线互连线相比更容易受电迁移的影响而产生失效。现有的电迁移分析方法和模型都主要针对单个互连线结构,这与包含有许多互连线树结构的实际集成电路芯片不符。因此,如何确保分析模型的准确性并且实现全芯片的电迁移分析是非常有必要的。本文应用基于物理特性的流体静应力分析模型,对常见互连线结构进行了有限元仿真并对应力分布进行了建模,将电迁移分析模型应用到具体的数字集成电路版图中进行分析,并制定了基于冗余过孔技术的电迁移修正算法和脚本,最终设计出一种与标准设计流程兼容的电迁移修复方法。数据结果表明:通过引入冗余过孔结构可以有效降低最大电流密度和温度梯度,延缓空洞的生长,使得电阻变化较为缓慢,从而提高电迁移寿命。从1x1过孔增加到1x3过孔,过孔失效中值时间提高了52.14\%;从1x3过孔增加到3x3过孔,过孔失效中值时间提高了14.04\%。综合考虑,1x3过孔在提高了电迁移抗性的前提下,所带来的布线面积的增加是最小的。通过对具体的集成电路版图电源地互连线网络电迁移分析得知,改善后的电源地互连线网络中流体静应力的峰值降低了49.29\%,应力平均值降低了44.28\%,应力标准差降低了43.04\%,说明本文提出的基于互连线树结构的电迁移应力分析模型是准确的,采用全芯片的分析方法是可行的,基于冗余过孔的修复算法是有效的。这在设计上为快速分析电迁移提供了方法,为提高芯片可靠性设计采用冗余过孔结构提供了理论支持。},

We present an efficient and general approach to GP inference based on Blackbox Matrix-Matrix multiplication (BBMM). BBMM inference uses a modified batched version of the conjugate gradients algorithm to derive all terms for training and inference in a single call. BBMM reduces the asymptotic complexity of exact GP inference from O(n(3)) to O(n(2)). Adapting this algorithm to scalable approximations and complex GP models simply requires a routine for efficient matrix-matrix multiplication with the kernel and its derivative. In addition, BBMM uses a specialized preconditioner to substantially speed up convergence. In experiments we show that BBMM effectively uses GPU hardware to dramatically accelerate both exact GP inference and scalable approximations. Additionally, we provide GPyTorch, a software platform for scalable GP inference via BBMM, built on PyTorch.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has been immensely successful at a variety of tasks, ranging from classification to artificial intelligence. Learning corresponds to fitting training data, which is implemented by descending a very high-dimensional loss function. Understanding under which conditions neural networks do not get stuck in poor minima of the loss, and how the landscape of that loss evolves as depth is increased, remains a challenge. Here we predict, and test empirically, an analogy between this landscape and the energy landscape of repulsive ellipses. We argue that in fully connected deep networks a phase transition delimits the over- and underparametrized regimes where fitting can or cannot be achieved. In the vicinity of this transition, properties of the curvature of the minima of the loss (the spectrum of the Hessian) are critical. This transition shares direct similarities with the jamming transition by which particles form a disordered solid as the density is increased, which also occurs in certain classes of computational optimization and learning problems such as the perceptron. Our analysis gives a simple explanation as to why poor minima of the loss cannot be encountered in the overparametrized regime. Interestingly, we observe that the ability of fully connected networks to fit random data is independent of their depth, an independence that appears to also hold for real data. We also study a quantity Delta which characterizes how well (Delta {$<$} 0) or badly (Delta {$>$} 0) a datum is learned. At the critical point it is power-law distributed on several decades, P+(Delta) similar to Delta(theta) for Delta {$>$} 0 and P\_(Delta) similar to (-Delta)(-gamma) for Delta {$<$} 0, with exponents that depend on the choice of activation function. This observation suggests that near the transition the loss landscape has a hierarchical structure and that the learning dynamics is prone to avalanche-like dynamics, with abrupt changes in the set of patterns that are learned.},

  abstract = {Supervised deep learning involves the training of neural networks with a large number N of parameters. For large enough N, in the so-called over-parametrized regime, one can essentially fit the training data points. Sparsitybased arguments would suggest that the generalization error increases as N grows past a certain threshold N*. Instead, empirical studies have shown that in the over-parametrized regime, generalization error keeps decreasing with N. We resolve this paradox through a new framework. We rely on the so-called Neural Tangent Kernel, which connects large neural nets to kernel methods, to show that the initialization causes finite-size random fluctuations parallel to f(N) - {$<$} f(N){$>$}parallel to similar to N-1/4 of the neural net output function f(N) around its expectation {$<$} f(N){$>$}. These affect the generalization error epsilon(f(N)) for classification: under natural assumptions, it decays to a plateau value epsilon(f(infinity)) in a power-law fashion similar to N-1/2. This description breaks down at a so-called jamming transition N = N*. At this threshold, we argue that parallel to f(N)parallel to diverges. This result leads to a plausible explanation for the cusp in test error known to occur at N*. Our results are confirmed by extensive empirical observations on the MNIST and CIFAR image datasets. Our analysis finally suggests that, given a computational envelope, the smallest generalization error is obtained using several networks of intermediate sizes, just beyond N*, and averaging their outputs.},

However, in their traditional form, such models can require a large amount of training data. This is of particular importance for various engineering and scientific applications where data may be extremely expensive to obtain. To overcome this shortcoming, physics-constrained deep learning provides a promising methodology as it only utilizes the governing equations. In this work, we propose a novel auto-regressive dense encoder-decoder convolutional neural network to solve and model non-linear dynamical systems without training data at a computational cost that is potentially magnitudes lower than standard numerical solvers. This model includes a Bayesian framework that allows for uncertainty quantification of the predicted quantities of interest at each time-step. We rigorously test this model on several non-linear transient partial differential equation systems including the turbulence of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, multi-shock formation and interaction with 1D Burgers' equation and 2D wave dynamics with coupled Burgers' equations. For each system, the predictive results and uncertainty are presented and discussed together with comparisons to the results obtained from traditional numerical analysis methods.

In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation.

  abstract = {In this work, we present a new physics informed neural network (PINN) algorithm for solving brittle fracture problems. While most of the PINN algorithms available in the literature minimize the residual of the governing partial differential equation, the proposed approach takes a different path by minimizing the variational energy of the system. Additionally, we modify the neural network output such that the boundary conditions associated with the problem are exactly satisfied. Compared to the conventional residual based PINN, the proposed approach has two major advantages. First, the imposition of boundary conditions is relatively simpler and more robust. Second, the order of derivatives present in the functional form of the variational energy is of lower order than in the residual form used in conventional PINN and hence, training the network is faster. To compute the total variational energy of the system, an efficient scheme that takes as input a geometry described by spline based CAD model and employs Gauss quadrature rules for numerical integration, has been proposed. Moreover, we note that for obtaining the crack path, the proposed PINN has to be trained at each load/displacement step, which can potentially make the algorithm computationally inefficient. To address this issue, we propose to use the concept 'transfer learning' wherein, instead of re-training the complete network, we only re-train the network partially while keeping the weights and the biases corresponding to the other portions fixed. With this setup, the computational efficiency of the proposed approach is significantly enhanced. The proposed approach is used to solve six fracture mechanics problems. For all the examples, results obtained using the proposed approach match closely with the results available in the literature. For the first two examples, we compare the results obtained using the proposed approach with the conventional residual based neural network results. For both the problems, the proposed approach is found to yield better accuracy compared to conventional residual based PINN algorithms.},

  abstract = {Microstructures encountered in the various metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes are unique because these form under rapid solidification conditions not frequently experienced elsewhere. Some of these highly nonequilibrium microstructures are subject to self-tempering or even forced to undergo recrystallisation when extra energy is supplied in the form of heat as adjacent layers are deposited. Further complexity arises from the fact that the same microstructure may be attained via more than one route-since many permutations and combinations available in terms of AM process parameters give rise to multiple phase transformation pathways. There are additional difficulties in obtaining insights into the underlying phenomena. For instance, the unstable, rapid and dynamic nature of the powder-based AM processes and the microscopic scale of the melt pool behaviour make it difficult to gather crucial information through in-situ observations of the process. Therefore, it is unsurprising that many of the mechanisms responsible for the final microstructures-including defects-found in AM parts are yet to be fully understood. Fortunately, however, computational modelling provides a means for recreating these processes in the virtual domain for testing theories-thereby discovering and rationalising the potential influences of various process parameters on microstructure formation mechanisms. In what is expected to be fertile ground for research and development for some time to come, modelling and experimental efforts that go hand in glove are likely to provide the fastest route to uncovering the unique and complex physical phenomena that determine metal AM microstructures. In this short Editorial, we summarise the status quo and identify research opportunities for modelling microstructures in AM. The vital role that will be played by machine learning (ML) models is also discussed.},

The current project phase is concerned with the characterization of millions of molecular motifs using first-principles quantum chemistry. The scale of this study requires a correspondingly large computational resource, which is provided by distributed volunteer computing on IBM's World Community Grid. The results are compiled and analyzed in a reference database and will be made available for public use. In addition to finding specific candidates with certain properties, it is the goal of CEP to illuminate and understand the structure property relations in the domain of organic electronics. Such insights can open the door to a rational and systematic design of future high-performance materials. The computational work in CEP is tightly embedded in a collaboration with experimentalists, who provide valuable input and feedback to the project.},

We illustrate, in a series of examples, how the framework can be used for curve fitting on discrete data, and for solution and discovery of PDEs in strong and weak forms. We summarize the features currently available in SciANN, and also outline ongoing and future developments. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This paper introduces a deep learning-based approach that can handle general high-dimensional parabolic PDEs. To this end, the PDEs are reformulated using backward stochastic differential equations and the gradient of the unknown solution is approximated by neural networks, very much in the spirit of deep reinforcement learning with the gradient acting as the policy function. Numerical results on examples including the nonlinear Black-Scholes equation, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and the Allen-Cahn equation suggest that the proposed algorithm is quite effective in high dimensions, in terms of both accuracy and cost. This opens up possibilities in economics, finance, operational research, and physics, by considering all participating agents, assets, resources, or particles together at the same time, instead of making ad hoc assumptions on their interrelationships.},

  abstract = {Measuring the maximum operating temperature within the channel of ultrawide band-gap transistors is critically important since the temperature dependence of the device reliability sets operational limits such as maximum operational power. Thermoreflectance imaging (TTI) is an optimal choice to measure the junction temperature due to its submicrometer spatial resolution and submicrosecond temporal resolution. Since TTI is an imaging technique, data acquisition is orders of magnitude faster than point measurement techniques such as Raman thermometry. Unfortunately, commercially available LED light sources used in thermoreflectance systems are limited to energies less than similar to 3.9 eV, which is below the band gap of many ultrawide band-gap semiconductors ({$>$}4.0 eV). Therefore, the semiconductors are transparent to the probing light sources, prohibiting the application of TTI. To address this thermal imaging challenge, we utilize an MoS2 coating as a thermoreflectance enhancement coating that allows for the measurement of the surface temperature of (ultra)wide band-gap materials. The coating consists of a network of MoS2 nanoflakes with the c axis aligned normal to the surface and is easily removable via sonication. The method is validated using electrical and thermal characterization of GaN and AlGaN devices. We demonstrate that this coating does not measurably influence the electrical performance or the measured operating temperature. A maximum temperature rise of 49 K at 0.59 W was measured within the channel of the AlGaN device, which is over double the maximum temperature rise obtained by measuring the thermoreflectance of the gate metal. The importance of accurately measuring the peak operational temperature is discussed in the context of accelerated stress testing.},

A number of 49 compositions were synthesized and their crystal structures, relative density of the sintered material, and Li-ion conductivity characterized. The co-doped compositions had a higher Li-ion conductivity than those doped with CaO or Y               2               O               3               alone. Furthermore, diffraction studies revealed that two phases and an impurity phase existed depending on the composition. Adding CaO significantly changed the relative density of the sintered material. Thus, to identify compositional dependencies among the Li-ion conductivity, phase stability, and relative density was complicated, and intuitively searching for the best composition was difficult. As a proof-of-concept, the collected data were used to demonstrate that the Bayesian optimization (BO) significantly improved the experimental search for the best oxide-based electrolyte composition. Multi-objective BO (MOBO), which considers more than two target performances, was also carried out. It was validated that the BO-guided experimental search determined more rapidly the best composition compared to conventional trial-and-error approaches employed in the materials industry.},

  abstract = {Environmental Sensor Networks (ESNs) facilitate the study of fundamental processes and the development of hazard response systems. They have evolved from passive logging systems that require manual downloading, into 'intelligent' sensor networks that comprise a network of automatic sensor nodes and communications systems which actively communicate their data to a Sensor Network Server (SNS) where these data can be integrated with other environmental datasets. The sensor nodes can be fixed or mobile and range in scale appropriate to the environment being sensed. ESN's range in scale and function and we have reviewed over 50 representative examples. Large Scale Single Function Networks tend to use large single purpose nodes to cover a wide geographical area. Localised Multifunction Sensor Networks typically monitor a small area in more detail, often with wireless ad-hoc systems. Biosensor Networks use emerging biotechnologies to monitor environmental processes as well as developing proxies for immediate use. In the future, sensor networks will integrate these three elements (Heterogeneous Sensor Networks). The communications system and data storage and integration (cyberinfrastructure) aspects of ESN's are discussed, along with current challenges which need to be addressed. We argue that Environmental Sensor Networks will become a standard research tool for future Earth System and Environmental Science. Not only do they provide a 'virtual' connection with the environment, they allow new field and conceptual approaches to the study of environmental processes to be developed. We suggest that although technological advances have facilitated these changes, it is vital that Earth Systems and Environmental Scientists utilise them. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This paper presents a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in AutoML. According to the DL pipeline, we introduce AutoML methods - covering data preparation, feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and neural architecture search (NAS) - with a particular focus on NAS, as it is currently a hot sub-topic of AutoML. We summarize the representative NAS algorithms' performance on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets and further discuss the following subjects of NAS methods: one/two-stage NAS, one-shot NAS, joint hyperparameter and architecture optimization, and resource-aware NAS. Finally, we discuss some open problems related to the existing AutoML methods for future research. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This model is based on close connections that we have observed and uncovered between the CNN and MG methodologies. For example, pooling operation and feature extraction in CNN correspond directly to restriction operation and iterative smoothers in MG, respectively. As the solution space is often the dual of the data space in PDEs, the analogous concept of feature space and data space (which are dual to each other) is introduced in CNN. With such connections and new concept in the unified model, the function of various convolution operations and pooling used in CNN can be better understood. As a result, modified CNN models (with fewer weights and hyperparameters) are developed that exhibit competitive and sometimes better performance in comparison with existing CNN models when applied to both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data sets.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the relationship between deep neural networks (DNN) with rectified linear unit (ReLU) function as the activation function and continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) functions, especially CPWL functions from the simplicial linear finite element method (FEM). We first consider the special case of FEM. By exploring the DNN representation of its nodal basis functions, we present a ReLU DNN representation of CPWL in FEM. We theoretically establish that at least 2 hidden layers are needed in a ReLU DNN to represent any linear finite element functions in Omega subset of R-d when d {$>$}= 2. Consequently, for d = 2, 3 which are often encountered in scientific and engineering computing, the minimal number of two hidden layers are necessary and sufficient for any CPWL function to be represented by a ReLU DNN. Then we include a detailed account on how a general CPWL in R d can be represented by a ReLU DNN with at most left perpendicular log(2) (d + 1) right perpendicular hidden layers and we also give an estimation of the number of neurons in DNN that are needed in such a representation. Furthermore, using the relationship between DNN and FEM, we theoretically argue that a special class of DNN models with low bit-width are still expected to have an adequate representation power in applications. Finally, as a proof of concept, we present some numerical results for using ReLU DNNs to solve a two point boundary problem to demonstrate the potential of applying DNN for numerical solution of partial differential equations.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a heuristic-based approach for transforming conditioned-based data (CBD) signatures into other signatures. Those signatures are highly correlated to changes in value (dP) of a parameter of interest (P-0) that degrades to a level of damage at which a component and its assembly no longer functions within operation specifications: functional failure occurs. CBD signatures can be expressed in terms of feature data (FD) plus noise where the magnitude of FD changes to create a signature in response to degradation. That FD-based signature can be expressed as ratio of a current measurement (FDi) to a nominal value (FD0) to form a fault-to-failure progression (FFP) signature. Further, a present measurement can be expressed as a nominal value times a degradation function of a change (dP(i)) in a parameter that has a nominal value P-0 in the absence of degradation. An FD-based signature is transformed into a fault-to-failure progression (FFP) signature by dividing a present FD by the nominal FD value and solving in terms of (dP(i)/P-0) to produce a degradation-progression signature \{DPSi\} which is a linearized version of an FFP signature. A DPS signature is further transformable into a functional failure signature, \{FFS\}, by dividing a DPS signature by a defined failure level. An FFS is amenable to processing as input to prediction algorithms because (1) its characteristic curve approaches an ideal straightline transfer curve as noise is ameliorated and/or mitigated; (2) its data has zero or negative values in the absence of degradation; (3) its data has positive values below 100 when there is degradation below a defined level of functional failure; and (4) its data has values at or above 100 when the level of degradation is at or above a level defined as functional failure. Even in the presence of noise and other effects, such as feedback, and even when the rate of degradation is nonlinear, an FSS is still has a very close to linear transfer curve. Seven sets of models have been developed to use for transformation of CBD signatures into FFS data. The models were developed based on the characteristic shapes of degradation signatures and confirmed by physics-of-failure (PoF) analysis and failure-mode effects analysis (FMEA). This paper presents a methodology for selecting and using those models to transform CBD-based signature data into FFS data for use as input to a prediction framework of a PHM system.},

The strong anchoring of intermediates is widely accepted to retard the shuttle of polysulfides in a working battery. However, the understanding of the intrinsic chemistry is still deficient. Inspired by the concept of hydrogen bond, herein we focus on the Li bond chemistry in Li\textendash S batteries through sophisticated quantum chemical calculations, in combination with 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Identified as Li bond, the strong dipole\textendash dipole interaction between Li polysulfides and Li\textendash S cathode materials originates from the electron-rich donors (e.g., pyridinic nitrogen (pN)), and enhanced by the inductive and conjugative effect of scaffold materials with {$\pi$}-electrons (e.g., graphene). The chemical shift of Li polysulfides in 7Li NMR, being both theoretically predicted and experimentally verified, is suggested to serve as a quantitative descriptor of Li bond strength. These theoretical insights were further proved by actual electrochemical tests. This work highlights the importance of Li bond chemistry in Li\textendash S cell and provides a deep comprehension, which is helpful to the cathode materials rational design and practical applications of Li\textendash S batteries.},

  abstract = {Lithium-metal anode batteries have the potential to serve as nextgeneration, high energy density batteries with high specific capacity and low electrode potential. However, due to the high reactivity of lithium, complex interfacial reactions and uncontrollable dendrite growth obstruct their application. These lithium-metal anode interfacial reactions are often accompanied by the organic electrolyte spontaneously decomposing and combustible gas subsequently escaping, which is a safety concern. It also affects the form of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which is important for stabilizing the interface between the Li-metal anode and electrolyte. Uncontrollable Li dendrite growth could penetrate the separator or electrolyte, creating the risk of a short circuit. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the lithium nucleation and deposition processes. Solid state electrolytes (SSEs) have also attracted attention for improving the energy density and safety of Li-ion batteries; however, problems such as poor ionic conductivity still exist. Computational simulations, such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and first-principles calculations based on density function theory (DFT), can help elucidate reaction mechanisms, explore electrode materials, and optimize battery design. In this review, we summarize the theoretical perspective gained from computational simulation studies of lithium-metal anodes. This review is organized into four sections: interfacial reactions, SEIs, lithium nucleation, and SSEs. We first explore organic-electrolyte interfacial reaction mechanisms that were revealed through MD simulations and how electrolyte additives, electrolyte concentration, operating temperature affect them. For SEI, DFT can provide an in-depth understanding of the surface chemical reaction, surface morphology, electrochemical properties, and kinetic characteristics of SEI. We review the developments in SEI transmission mechanisms and SEI materials' properties alteration by lithium metal. We further explore artificial SEI design requirements and compare the performances of artificial SEIs, including double-layer, fluorine-, and sulfur-SEIs. Lithium dendrite growth as a result of lithium nucleation and deposition is then discussed, focusing on computational studies that evaluated how doped graphene, 3D carbon fibers, porous metals, and other matrix materials regulated these processes and inhibited dendrite growth. Computational simulations evaluating transport phenomena and interface reactions between SSEs and lithium-metal anodes are then explored, followed by ideas for further design optimization. Finally, potential research directions and perspectives in this field are proposed and discussed.},

VRDM takes sub-system, component or part level failure mode testing data that capture key quantitative and parametric testing information, called variable testing data, to estimate the sub-system/component/part reliability and confidence's (R/C's), and then aggregates these sub-system/component/part R/C's to derive the system R/C. The paper shows VRDM not only has potential for significantly reducing the sample size compared with the traditional binomial reliability demonstration model (BRDM) for the same R/C requirement, but also provides useful and relevant variable data for assisting reliability design and testing optimization which could be neglected or overlooked by BRDM. The description of VRDM is presented, and several examples are illustrated to verify the usefulness of VRDM for assisting reliability design improvement.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a variable reliability demonstration model (VRDM) that is based on a physics failure reliability model with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) as a calculation tool. VRDM takes sub-system, component or part level failure mode testing data that capture key quantitative and parametric testing information, called variable testing data, to estimate the sub-system/component/part reliability and confidence's (R/C's), and then aggregates these sub-system/component/part R/C's to derive the system R/C. The paper shows VRDM not only has potential for significantly reducing the sample size compared with the traditional binomial reliability demonstration model (BRDM) for the same R/C requirement, but also provides useful and relevant variable data for assisting reliability design and testing optimization which could be neglected or overlooked by BRDM. The description of VRDM is presented, and several examples are illustrated to verify the usefulness of VRDM for assisting reliability design improvement.},

  abstract = {Cu               2               S NWs are grown inside a commercial Cu foam which help realize the uniform lithium deposition and suppress the dendrite growth by the increased surface area and lithiophilic surface modification at the same time.                        ,                             Lithium metal is the most promising anode for next-generation rechargeable lithium batteries but Li dendrite growth and the resulting safety issues resulting from the non-uniform Li deposition hinder its practical use. Considering the high cost and complication of the currently reported approaches to suppress the Li dendrite growth, in this study we have modified a low-cost commercial three-dimensional (3D) Cu foam into a high-performance host for stable Li deposition by the growth of Cu               2               S nanowires (NWs) inside the Cu framework. The Cu               2               S NWs were grown by a simple and scalable chemical approach, and they reduce the local current density and homogenize the Li ion distribution because of the increased contact area of the 3D Cu               2               S NWs/Cu with the electrolyte. They also enable the formation of a protective solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film containing Li               2               S               2               /Li               2               S. The prepared 3D Cu               2               S NWs/Cu current collector enables dendrite-free Li deposition/stripping and gives a stable cycling performance with a high coulombic efficiency (95.5\% for more than 150 cycles at 2 mA cm               -2               ). Full cells with LiFePO               4               as the cathode also exhibit improved cycling stability and improved coulombic efficiency, showing the potential of this host in the use of stable Li metal anodes.},

However, for tasks involving large sets of candidate molecules, running DFT separately for every possible compound of interest is forbiddingly expensive. In this paper, we propose a neural network based machine learning algorithm which, assuming a sufficiently large training sample of actual DFT results, can instead learn to predict certain properties of molecules purely from their molecular graphs. Our algorithm is based on the recently proposed covariant compositional networks framework and involves tensor reduction operations that are covariant with respect to permutations of the atoms. This new approach avoids some of the representational limitations of other neural networks that are popular in learning from molecular graphs and yields promising results in numerical experiments on the Harvard Clean Energy Project and QM9 molecular datasets.

Marine industry has been developing day by day and attention is increasingly focused on the safety of ships and crews, as well as on the protection of marine environment.

  abstract = {We propose a conservative physics-informed neural network (cPINN) on discrete domains for nonlinear conservation laws. Here, the term discrete domain represents the discrete sub-domains obtained after division of the computational domain, where PINN is applied and the conservation property of cPINN is obtained by enforcing the flux continuity in the strong form along the sub-domain interfaces. In case of hyperbolic conservation laws, the convective flux contributes at the interfaces, whereas in case of viscous conservation laws, both convective and diffusive fluxes contribute. Apart from the flux continuity condition, an average solution (given by two different neural networks) is also enforced at the common interface between two sub-domains. One can also employ a deep neural network in the domain, where the solution may have complex structure, whereas a shallow neural network can be used in the sub-domains with relatively simple and smooth solutions. Another advantage of the proposed method is the additional freedom it gives in terms of the choice of optimization algorithm and the various training parameters like residual points, activation function, width and depth of the network etc. Various forms of errors involved in cPINN such as optimization, generalization and approximation errors and their sources are discussed briefly. In cPINN, locally adaptive activation functions are used, hence training the model faster compared to its fixed counterparts. Both, forward and inverse problems are solved using the proposed method. Various test cases ranging from scalar nonlinear conservation laws like Burgers, Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations to systems of conservation laws, like compressible Euler equations are solved. The lid-driven cavity test case governed by incompressible Navier-Stokes equation is also solved and the results are compared against a benchmark solution. The proposed method enjoys the property of domain decomposition with separate neural networks in each sub-domain, and it efficiently lends itself to parallelized computation, where each sub-domain can be assigned to a different computational node.

  abstract = {We propose a generalized space-time domain decomposition approach for the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) on arbitrary complex-geometry domains. The proposed framework, named eXtended PINNs (XPINNs), further pushes the boundaries of both PINNs as well as conservative PINNs (cPINNs), which is a recently proposed domain decomposition approach in the PINN framework tailored to conservation laws. Compared to PINN, the XPINN method has large representation and parallelization capacity due to the inherent property of deployment of multiple neural networks in the smaller sub domains. Unlike cPINN, XPINN can be extended to any type of PDEs. Moreover, the domain can be decomposed in any arbitrary way (in space and time), which is not possible in cPINN. Thus, XPINN offers both space and time parallelization, thereby reducing the training cost more effectively. In each subdomain, a separate neural network is employed with optimally selected hyperparameters, e.g., depth/width of the network, number and location of residual points, activation function, optimization method, etc. A deep network can be employed in a subdomain with complex solution, whereas a shallow neural network can be used in a subdomain with relatively simple and smooth solutions. We demonstrate the versatility of XPINN by solving both forward and inverse PDE problems, ranging from one-dimensional to three-dimensional problems, from time-dependent to time-independent problems, and from continuous to discontinuous problems, which clearly shows that the XPINN method is promising in many practical problems. The proposed XPINN method is the generalization of PINN and cPINN methods, both in terms of applicability as well as domain decomposition approach, which efficiently lends itself to parallelized computation. The XPINN code is available on https://github.com/AmeyaJagtap/XPINNs.},

  abstract = {We propose two approaches of locally adaptive activation functions namely, layer-wise and neuron-wise locally adaptive activation functions, which improve the performance of deep and physics-informed neural networks. The local adaptation of activation function is achieved by introducing a scalable parameter in each layer (layer-wise) and for every neuron (neuron-wise) separately, and then optimizing it using a variant of stochastic gradient descent algorithm. In order to further increase the training speed, an activation slope-based slope recovery term is added in the loss function, which further accelerates convergence, thereby reducing the training cost. On the theoretical side, we prove that in the proposed method, the gradient descent algorithms are not attracted to sub-optimal critical points or local minima under practical conditions on the initialization and learning rate, and that the gradient dynamics of the proposed method is not achievable by base methods with any (adaptive) learning rates. We further show that the adaptive activation methods accelerate the convergence by implicitly multiplying conditioning matrices to the gradient of the base method without any explicit computation of the conditioning matrix and the matrix-vector product. The different adaptive activation functions are shown to induce different implicit conditioning matrices. Furthermore, the proposed methods with the slope recovery are shown to accelerate the training process.},

Six regimes of lithium electrodeposit growth are identified: (i) thermodynamic suppression regime, (ii) incubation regime, (iii) base-controlled regime, (iv) tip-controlled regime, (v) mixed regime, and (vi) Sand's regime.},

Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and development of a simple electrostatic model we study the structure and mechanism of LiF growth on graphene. We find that, independent of being in contact or not with the graphene surface, crystalline-LiF nanoclusters (NCs) with (100) facets grow in a three-dimensional mode. These findings are in agreement with recent experimental studies on graphene anodes. We also find that the stabilities of LiF NCs can be predicted by a simple electrostatic model for ionic NCs. Since the main components of the SEI layer are ionic compounds, this study shows how electrostatic effects can control the atomic structure of the SEI layer in Li-ion batteries.},

In particular, we define two classes of SympNets: the LA-SympNets composed of linear and activation modules, and the G-SympNets composed of gradient modules. Correspondingly, we prove two new universal approximation theorems that demonstrate that SympNets can approximate arbitrary symplectic maps based on appropriate activation functions. We then perform several experiments including the pendulum, double pendulum and three-body problems to investigate the expressivity and the generalization ability of SympNets. The simulation results show that even very small size SympNets can generalize well, and are able to handle both separable and non-separable Hamiltonian systems with data points resulting from short or long time steps. In all the test cases, SympNets outperform the baseline models, and are much faster in training and prediction. We also develop an extended version of SympNets to learn the dynamics from irregularly sampled data. This extended version of SympNets can be thought of as a universal model representing the solution to an arbitrary Hamiltonian system. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Several research efforts have studied physics of failure (PoF) of different materials, along with datadriven approaches as an alternative to the traditional PoF studies. To bridge the gap between these two techniques, we propose a novel hybrid framework for fatigue crack length estimation and prediction. Physics-based modeling is performed on the fracture mechanics degradation data by estimating parameters of the Paris Law, including the associated uncertainties. Crack length estimations are inferred by feeding manually extracted features from ultrasonic signals to a Neural Network (NN). The crack length prediction is then performed using the Particle Filter (PF) approach, which takes the Paris Law as a move function and uses the NN's output as observation to update the crack growth path. This hybrid framework combines machine learning, physics-based modeling, and Bayesian updating with promising results.},

  abstract = {Despite great progress in simulating multiphysics problems using the numerical discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs), one still cannot seamlessly incorporate noisy data into existing algorithms, mesh generation remains complex, and high-d imensional problems governed by parameterized PDEs cannot be tackled. Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-t ime domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-b ased regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-d imensional problems.},

  abstract = {Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) are ubiquitous in engineering and computational sciences. The stochasticity arises as a consequence of uncertainty in input parameters, constitutive relations, initial/boundary conditions, etc. Because of these functional uncertainties, the stochastic parameter space is often high-dimensional, requiring hundreds, or even thousands, of parameters to describe it. This poses an insurmountable challenge to response surface modeling since the number of forward model evaluations needed to construct an accurate surrogate grows exponentially with the dimension of the uncertain parameter space; a phenomenon referred to as the curse of dimensionality. State-of-the-art methods for high-dimensional uncertainty propagation seek to alleviate the curse of dimensionality by performing dimensionality reduction in the uncertain parameter space. However, one still needs to perform forward model evaluations that potentially carry a very high computational burden. We propose a novel methodology for high-dimensional uncertainty propagation of elliptic SPDEs which lifts the requirement for a deterministic forward solver. Our approach is as follows. We parameterize the solution of the elliptic SPDE using a deep residual network (ResNet). In a departure from traditional squared residual (SR) based loss function for training the ResNet, we introduce a physics-informed loss function derived from variational principles. Specifically, our loss function is the expectation of the energy functional of the PDE over the stochastic variables. We demonstrate our solver-free approach through various examples where the elliptic SPDE is subjected to different types of high-dimensional input uncertainties. Also, we solve high-dimensional uncertainty propagation and inverse problems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {We present a novel deep learning framework for flow field predictions in irregular domains when the solution is a function of the geometry of either the domain or objects inside the domain. Grid vertices in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) domain are viewed as point clouds and used as inputs to a neural network based on the PointNet architecture, which learns an end-to-end mapping between spatial positions and CFD quantities. Using our approach, (i) the network inherits desirable features of unstructured meshes (e.g., fine and coarse point spacing near the object surface and in the far field, respectively), which minimizes network training cost; (ii) object geometry is accurately represented through vertices located on object boundaries, which maintains boundary smoothness and allows the network to detect small changes between geometries and (iii) no data interpolation is utilized for creating training data; thus accuracy of the CFD data is preserved. None of these features are achievable by extant methods based on projecting scattered CFD data into Cartesian grids and then using regular convolutional neural networks. Incompressible laminar steady flow past a cylinder with various shapes for its cross section is considered. The mass and momentum of predicted fields are conserved. We test the generalizability of our network by predicting the flow around multiple objects as well as an airfoil, even though only single objects and no airfoils are observed during training. The network predicts the flow fields hundreds of times faster than our conventional CFD solver, while maintaining excellent to reasonable accuracy.},

  abstract = {Manifold-learning techniques are routinely used in mining complex spatiotemporal data to extract useful, parsimonious data representations/parametrizations; these are, in turn, useful in nonlinear model identification tasks. We focus here on the case of time series data that can ultimately be modeled as a spatially distributed system [e.g., a partial differential equation (PDE)], but where we do not know the space in which this PDE should be formulated. Hence, even the spatial coordinates for the distributed system themselves need to be identified-to "emerge from"-the data mining process. We will first validate this "emergent space" reconstruction for time series sampled without space labels in known PDEs; this brings up the issue of observability of physical space from temporal observation data and the transition from spatially resolved to lumped (order-parameter-based) representations by tuning the scale of the data mining kernels. We will then present actual emergent space "discovery" illustrations. Our illustrative examples include chimera states (states of coexisting coherent and incoherent dynamics), and chaotic as well as quasiperiodic spatiotemporal dynamics, arising in partial differential equations and/or in heterogeneous networks. We also discuss how data-driven "spatial" coordinates can be extracted in ways invariant to the nature of the measuring instrument. Such gauge-invariant data mining can go beyond the fusion of heterogeneous observations of the same system, to the possible matching of apparently different systems.},

Structural health management is a vital part of IVHM as arguably structures are the biggest and most costly part of the system, thus the failure of the structure could lead to catastrophic results. The failure of a structure is usually caused by cracks or fractures, to identify the cracks and their growth would be desirable for the SHM. While detection of cracks and the prediction of crack growth is a daunting task, demarcation of the crack is essential to prevent failures. This article presents a technique for the prognostic of crack propagation through aluminium by utilising a time delay neural network algorithm.

Such models can be nowadays deployed on large patient-specific topologies of systemic arterial networks and return detailed predictions on flow patterns, wall shear stresses, and pulse wave propagation. However, their success heavily relies on tedious pre-processing and calibration procedures that typically induce a significant computational cost, thus hampering their clinical applicability. In this work we put forth a machine learning framework that enables the seamless synthesis of non-invasive in-vivo measurement techniques and computational flow dynamics models derived from first physical principles. We illustrate this new paradigm by showing how one-dimensional models of pulsatile flow can be used to constrain the output of deep neural networks such that their predictions satisfy the conservation of mass and momentum principles. Once trained on noisy and scattered clinical data of flow and wall displacement, these networks can return physically consistent predictions for velocity, pressure and wall displacement pulse wave propagation, all without the need to employ conventional simulators. A simple post-processing of these outputs can also provide a relatively cheap and effective way for estimating Windkessel model parameters that are required for the calibration of traditional computational models. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated through a series of prototype benchmarks, as well as a realistic clinical case involving in-vivo measurements near the aorta/carotid bifurcation of a healthy human subject.

Vibration monitoring is widely used for the WT gearbox, which is a component with a significant downtime. Given that the installed wind capacity grows, the volume of CM data increases, making manual interpretation of vibration signals challenging. Therefore, there is a need for an efficient and automated maintenance decision support system. The aim to this paper is to propose an automated framework for gearbox incipient failure diagnosis. The framework utilises vibration signals and performs health estimation and fault isolation based on signal processing and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques.

  abstract = {This paper shows three different methods for planning reliability growth tests. One method is based on purely mathematical principles, and two additional methods are based on the Physics of Failure (PoF) principles. Our mathematical method determines test duration as a function of the initial failure rate of the design related failure modes that are being mitigated and the desired final, reduced failure rate. This method also includes the failure rate of random, but uncorrected design failure modes which were not accounted for previously. With this inclusion, the test may need to be accelerated to manage its potentially very long duration which introduces some limited PoF aspects into this test type. Fitting the required use exposure to the expected stresses may also present a challenge. The first PoF method, the Failure Free Test Approach, has a basic duration equal to the required product life, but it is then extended for validation of achieved reliability. This method establishes relationships among the stresses in use and the product life. The only deficiency of the method is the uncertainty about the duration of the failure free test extension. In the case of failures during the failure free period, sequential extensions may result in a very lengthy, even uncontrollable, test duration. The second PoF method, the Demonstrated Strength Approach, provides a fixed duration test where additional degradation of the product ensures a margin which is commensurate with the desired final product reliability. The test duration here is known in advance, so the test planning is easy and straightforward. The PoF reliability growth/demonstration tests are designed to represent a product as it is used and for the duration of its use. They therefore provide reasonable insight into its lifetime reliability. For that reason, they are preferred over the mathematically planned tests.},

The first part satisfies the initial/boundary conditions and contains no adjustable parameters. The second part is constructed so as not to affect the initial/boundary conditions. This part involves a feedforward neural net work containing adjustable parameters (the weights). Hence by construction the initial/boundary conditions are satisfied and the network is trained to satisfy the differential equation. The applicability of this approach ranges from single ordinary differential equations (ODE's), to systems of coupled ODE's and also to partial differential equations (PDE's). In this article, we illustrate the method by solving a variety of model problems and present comparisons with solutions obtained using the Galekrkin finite element method for several cases of partial differential equations. With the advent of neuroprocessors and digital signal processors the method becomes particularly interesting due to the expected essential gains in the execution speed.},

However, the sensitive strain rate of solder joint was important to take it into consideration since the solder joint was suffered the impact pulse during the drop test. In line with the drop test standard (JEDEC condition B), the test vehicle was subjected to impact loading with the peak acceleration of 1500 G for a period of 0.5 ms. This scenario ensured that the solder joint connecting the package and the test board was subjected to the impact loading for a very short time.

The aim was to calculate the solder joint fatigue life by combining the results of finite element modeling with those obtained by experimental testing. The finite element model was used to analyze the stress and strain of the solder joint during the drop test. The model was developed using ANSYS/LS-DYNA and yielded a dynamic explicit solution.

As the electronic components arc to be easily normalized on the reliability evaluation, many reliability prediction methodologies are used. In this study, integrated reference model of reliability prediction is serviced for existing PRISM and Bellcore which is related on reliability prediction about electronic components, and will service reliability data based on PoF (Physics of Failure) from domestic research center. The constructed frame of reliability evaluation system, which can predict and evaluate reliability of electronic components and MEMS, is designed by using online service of the reliability data accumulated on web. To evaluate proposed system, the reliability evaluation of PCB (Printed Circuits Boards), which is used in NC controller of machine tools, is introduced according to PRISM, the representative reference model of reliability prediction about electronic components based on MIL-HDBK-217F.},

  abstract = {The development of the theory and application of Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods, vast improvements in computational capabilities and emerging software alternatives have made it possible for more frequent use of Bayesian methods in reliability applications. Bayesian methods, however, remain controversial in Reliability (and some other applications) because of the concern about where the needed prior distributions should come from. On the other hand, there are many applications where engineers have solid prior information on certain aspects of their reliability problems based on physics of failure or previous experience with the same failure mechanism. For example, engineers often have useful but imprecise knowledge about the effective activation energy in a temperature-accelerated life test or about the Weibull shape parameter in the analysis of fatigue failure data. In such applications, the use of Bayesian methods is compelling as it offers an appropriate compromise between assuming that such quantities are known and assuming that nothing is known. In this paper we compare the use of Bayesian methods with the traditional maximum likelihood methods for a group of examples including the analysis of field data with multiple censoring, accelerated life test data, and accelerated degradation test data.},

  abstract = {In early product development stages, reliability growth testing (RGT) has been traditionally used for reliability monitoring and prediction through testing data. It has been criticized that the traditional reliability growth models are not only costly but also time consuming in terms of discovering and fixing potential failure modes. To tackle such challenges, accelerated reliability growth testing methods are adopted in industry. However, system level reliability growth testing can be still very challenging due to the stringent budget and tight product development cycle. On the other hand, reliability knowledge and information from the product development and design processes have not been well utilized for reliability prediction and management. These information include design simulation outcomes from finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid analysis (CFD), physics-of-failure (PoF) failure models and failure analysis from field failure events, and manufacturing defect reports. Such reliability information are usually included in the design failure mode and effect analysis (DFMEA) reports. This research explores a method for system reliability prediction by aggregating all the above mentioned reliability knowledge embedded in DFMEA. Specifically, we propose to utilize the failure frequency and detection assessments of the potential failure modes in DFMEA for system level reliability prediction through a set of Weibull models with three categories of failure rates. The three failure categories are modeled using Weibull models with unique shape parameters for each of the failure types. The characteristic life associated with each failure category is derived from the occurrence rate of the DFMEA outcomes. The component level failure information is further aggregated to the higher subsystem and system level reliability in a hierarchical way. In addition, failure detection assessments are incorporated into the Weibull models to monitor and predict the reliability growth over time. The proposed DFMEA-based reliability prediction method can well aggregate all the reliability knowledge from multiple design experts and increasingly adopted engineering analytical analysis. The traditional RGT outcomes can also be integrated into the proposed Weibull reliability prediction model.

While innovative process integration schemes, especially direct and indirect Cu/cap interface engineering, have proven effective to suppress Cu diffusion and enhance the EM performance, the strategies for circuit/chip designs to take advantage of specific layout and EM failure characteristics are equally important to ensure overall EM reliability and optimized performance. To enable future technology scaling, a co-optimization approach is essential including interconnect process development, circuit design and chip integration.},

However, modeling for a complex dynamic system is still challenging due to the diversity of components and failure mechanisms, various types of correlation at each level of system hierarchy. In this paper, a new definition of agent model is defined within the system reliability modeling field, three classes of agents are assigned to entities at different level of system, from conditional factors to the whole system, considering the physical characteristics of agents' counterparts. Then, the learning method for agents updating are proposed to mimic the system evolution according to the degradation or failure process. Finally, taking the bearing under a correlative fatigue-wear mechanism as an example, the agent model is constructed and the reliability status of specimen is estimated by agent learning. Analysis of the results indicates that agent model of system reliability can help understanding the uncertainty and make evaluation more accurate. This paper mainly focuses on the modeling method, however, the way to improve the efficiency of evaluation is not included, which we plan to discuss further.},

This paper presents a method of using deep neural networks to learn a model for the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor from high-fidelity simulation data. A novel neural network architecture is proposed which uses a multiplicative layer with an invariant tensor basis to embed Galilean invariance into the predicted anisotropy tensor. It is demonstrated that this neural network architecture provides improved prediction accuracy compared with a generic neural network architecture that does not embed this invariance property. The Reynolds stress anisotropy predictions of this invariant neural network are propagated through to the velocity field for two test cases. For both test cases, significant improvement versus baseline RANS linear eddy viscosity and nonlinear eddy viscosity models is demonstrated.},

To address this issue, daily gavage of oyster polypeptides was performed to investigate their protective effect, basing on d-galactose-induced POF model in C57BL/6 female mice. RESULTS Oyster polypeptides restored the irregular estrous cycles and the abnormal serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and progesterone (P) levels as well as the decreased mRNA expression level of Amh that were induced by d-galactose. The follicle development of POF mice was improved by increasing the primordial follicle ratio and decreasing the atretic follicle number after oral administration of oyster polypeptides. Moreover, in the oyster polypeptides treated mice, the total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity was significantly increased, while the malondialdehyde levels were significantly decreased. The mRNA expression levels of stress-related genes (SOD2, SIRT1 and FOXO3a) were remarkably up-regulated after d-galactose induction, but the up-regulation was weakened or disappeared by the gavage of oyster polypeptides. In addition, oyster polypeptides treatment also reduced the apoptosis of the ovarian granulosa cells and down-regulated the mRNA expression levels of apoptosis-related genes (p53 and Bad but not Bcl-2). CONCLUSION This study reveals that oyster polypeptides may protect ovary against d-galactose-induced POF by their anti-oxidative stress activity to rescue d-galactose-induced ovarian oxidative damage and therefore to prevent ovarian cells apoptosis, thereby tipping the abnormality trigged by POF to get close to the normal levels.

  abstract = {在电子封装无铅化的背景下,Sn基无铅焊点往往由有限个Sn晶粒构成,呈现出单晶或者孪晶结构。由于{$\beta$}-Sn晶胞的各向异性,这种晶粒有限化的焊点,其电迁移行为也表现出明显的各向异性。研究表明,通过细化焊点的Sn晶体取向可以提高其电迁移可靠性。本课题以Sn3Ag3Bi3In钎料为研究对象,在不同焊接峰值温度下,制备线性焊点。使用SEM、EBSD及EPMA等技术对焊点的显微组织、晶体取向结构进行表征。结合Sn3.5Ag及Sn3.0Ag0.5Cu无铅钎料,对比研究Sn3Ag3Bi3In焊点的力学性能。之后,对具有不同晶体取向结构焊点的电迁移行为进行分析研究。研究发现Sn3Ag3Bi3In焊点内部以白色的{$\beta$}-Sn为基体,颗粒状的Cu\_6(Sn,In)\_5及富Ag相{$\zeta$}(Ag\_4Sn及Ag\_3In的固溶体)弥散分布其中。界面处IMC:靠近Sn基体一侧较厚的IMC为Cu\_6(Sn,In)\_5,靠近Cu基板侧较薄的IMC为Cu\_3(Sn,In),这是因为In元素具有与Sn元素相近的物理、化学性质,从而发生了In原子替代了Cu\_6Sn\_5及Cu\_3Sn晶格位置上的Sn原子而形成。回流焊接之后的Sn3Ag3Bi3In线性焊点具有单晶(single crystal)、多晶粒(multi-crystalline)、多晶(polycrystalline)的晶体结构,孪晶焊点多为``interlace twin''的结构形式。可能是由于Sn3Ag3Bi3In钎料自身低的过冷度为多晶结构的形成提供了条件。此外,随着焊接峰值温度升高,焊点内部的Sn晶粒得到了细化,这可能是由于温度越高、焊点凝固过程中的冷却速度越大、冷速越大促进熔体的过冷、进而促进Sn晶粒形核。Sn3Ag3Bi3In钎料制备的焊点具有比Sn3.5Ag及Sn3.0Ag0.5Cu更高的显微硬度及拉伸强度。此外,单晶焊点的电迁移实验阐述了{$\beta$}-Sn的各向异性对电迁移行为的影响。孪晶焊点的电迁移行为由构成焊点的三个取向的晶粒共同决定。值得注意的是,多晶焊点具有可与c轴与电流方向近乎垂直的单晶焊点相比拟的电迁移可靠性。这可能是由于多晶焊点内Sn晶粒取向杂乱分布,焊点呈现出``各向同性''的特征。因此,由{$\beta$}-Sn晶胞的各向异性导致``原子扩散沿着c轴比沿着a/b轴扩散快''的法则在多晶焊点中不再适用。说明晶粒细化确实可以提高焊点的电迁移可靠性。最后,电迁移过后,焊点内部及界面处的Cu\_6(Sn,In)\_5中的In元素的含量相比初始焊点有所增加,这是由于电迁移过程中{$\zeta$}相参与了与Cu、Sn原子的反应。},

  abstract = {Accurate and reliable remaining useful life (RUL) assessment result provides decision-makers valuable information to take suitable maintenance strategy to maximize the equipment usage and avoid costly failure. The conventional RUL prediction methods include model-based and data-driven. However, with the rapid development of modern industries, the physical model is becoming less capable of describing sophisticated systems, and the traditional data-driven methods have limited ability to learn sophisticated features. To overcome these problems, a multi-scale deep convolutional neural network (MS-DCNN) which have powerful feature extraction capability due to its multi-scale structure is proposed in this paper. This network constructs a direct relationship between Condition Monitoring (CM) data and ground-RUL without using any prior information. The MS-DCNN has three multi-scale blocks (MS-BLOCKs), where three different sizes of convolution operations are put on each block in parallel. This structure improves the network's ability to learn complex features by extracting features of different scales. The developed algorithm includes three stages: data pre-processing, model training, and RUL prediction. After the min\textendash max normalization pre-processing, the data is sent to the MS-DCNN network for parameter training directly, and the associated RUL value can be estimated base on the learned representations. Regularization helps to improve prediction accuracy and alleviate the overfitting problem. We evaluate the method on the available modular aeropropulsion system simulation data (C-MAPSS dataset) from NASA. The results show that the proposed method achieves good prognostics performance compared with other network architectures and stateof-the-art methods. RUL prediction result is obtained precisely without increasing the calculation burden.},

  abstract = {The Li metal anode is considered the most promising anode for nextgeneration high energy density batteries owing to its high theoretical capacity and low electrode potential. The development of batteries with high energy density is essential to meet the growing demand for energy storage devices in the modern world. However, the Li metal anode has operational problems. The high activity of Li causes dendritic growth during the cycling process, which leads to the cracking of the SEI (solid-electrolyte interphase), increased side reactions, and formation of dead Li. Furthermore, if the growth of Li dendrites is left uncontrolled, it can penetrate the separator and create a short-circuit accompanied by thermal runaway. Additionally, the complete utilization of active Li is challenged by the infinite volume expansion of the Li anode. To improve the application scope of Li metal batteries, it is imperative to develop advanced strategies for inhibiting Li dendritic growth, enhancing the stability of the SEI, reducing the accumulation of dead Li, and buffering the volume expansion. Understanding the mechanisms and models of Li nucleation and growth provides insight into solving these problems. This review summarizes some of the important models of Li nucleation and growth such as the surface nucleating model, charge-induced model, SEI model, and deposition/dissolution model. These models aid comprehension of the Li nucleation and growth process under various conditions. This review also discusses the strategies explored in the literature for improving the electrodes (such as three-dimensional (3D) matrix), electrolyte, SEI, and separator to realize uniform deposition of Li and improved utilization of Li. The 3D matrix strategy for improving the electrode design explores various matrices including graphene-based, carbon fiber-based, porous metal-based, and powder-based for buffering the volume expansion and reducing the local current density. To improve the electrolyte, concentrated lithium salts and functional additives are employed to stabilize the SEI and inhibit dendritic growth by regulating the chemical composition of SEI and inducing the deposition of Li. With respect to improving the design of the SEI, strategies for the construction of inorganic or organic components with high ionic conductivity and stable structure are explored for even distribution of Li ions and to avoid SEI rupture. This can reduce electrolyte consumption and dead Li formation. The modification of the separator by functional nanocarbon layer can control the direction of dendritic growth, thereby preventing the penetration of dendrites into the separator and achieving a uniform Li deposition layer. Finally, all solid state Li metal batteries (ASSLMBs) are discussed that utilize ceramic and polymer electrolytes owing to high safety of the solid state electrolyte. Therefore, reducing the interfacial resistance and suppressing dendritic growth between the Li anode and the electrolyte is key for the practical applications of ASSLMBs. Overall, this review provides a summary and outlook for promoting the practical applications of Li metal batteries.},

The radial scaling converts the problem of approximation of high frequency contents of PDEs' solutions to a problem of learning about lower frequency functions, and the compact support activation functions facilitate the separation of frequency contents of the target function to be approximated by corresponding DNNs. As a result, the MscaleDNNs achieve fast uniform convergence over multiple scales. The proposed MscaleDNNs are shown to be superior to traditional fully connected DNNs and be an effective mesh-less numerical method for Poisson-Boltzmann equations with ample frequency contents over complex and singular domains.},

  year = {2018},
  abstract = {随着3D电子封装的高速发展,微焊点的尺寸急剧减小,使得微焊点中仅存在单个或者数个Sn晶粒。Sn原子在固态下以{$\beta$}-Sn体心四方结构存在,表现出显著的扩散各向异性,对微焊点电迁移行为有着强烈影响。Ni由于在回流过程和Sn有着较低的反应速率而被广泛应用于电子封装中。因此,亟待研究Sn晶粒取向对典型的Cu/Sn/Ni结构线性焊点的电迁移行为影响。本论文首先采用原位电迁移实验研究了Cu/Sn/Ni线性焊点在Ni作阴极时的固-固电迁移行为,并与Cu/SAC305/Cu线性焊点进行了对比。在研究中发现Ni基板溶解理论计算值与实验值相差较大,即阴极界面处(Cu,Ni)\_6Sn\_5对Ni原子电迁移扩散有阻碍作用。并利用EBSD排除Sn扩散各向异性对焊点电迁移行为的影响,通过不同时效工艺控制(Cu,Ni)\_6Sn\_5层厚度,对(Cu,Ni)\_6Sn\_5阻碍Ni原子电迁移扩散行为进行研究。本论文主要结论如下:(1)在通电时间相同条件下,Ni基板的溶解量随着\texttheta 角({$\beta$}-Sn晶粒的c轴与电子流动方向的夹角)的增大而减小,与cos\textasciitilde 2\texttheta 呈线性关系。并根据阴极界面处(Cu,Ni)\_6Sn\_5阻碍Ni原子电迁移扩散作用对Ni基板的溶解模型加以修正。(2)当电子由小\texttheta 角晶粒流向大\texttheta 角晶粒时,阴极侧Ni基板会大量溶解,大量(Ni,Cu)\_3Sn\_4型IMC会在小\texttheta 角晶粒中聚集析出,最终阴极过量溶解、阴极界面处开裂会造成焊点电迁移失效;当电子由大\texttheta 角晶粒流向小\texttheta 角晶粒时,阴极侧Ni基板极少溶解,在钎料内部无大量IMC聚集析出,阴极界面处有凹陷裂纹、微空洞等Sn的自扩散现象。(3)在相同Sn晶粒取向下,对比Ni、Cu不同基板作阴极时焊点的电迁移行为,发现两者在损伤失效模式上有较大差异,并基于Ni/Cu扩散通量比值、IMC聚集析出造成体积收缩等观点进行了解释说明。(4)从晶粒尺寸、晶界扩散通量、热力学稳定性角度解释了(Cu,Ni)\_6Sn\_5阻碍Ni原子电迁移扩散机制。具体为:Ni基板溶解主要受Ni原子在IMC中晶界扩散通量控制;IMC层厚度的增加将导致IMC晶粒尺寸的增大,进而导致晶界面积的减小,抑制Ni原子沿晶界扩散;(Cu,Ni)\_6Sn\_5随着Ni含量的增加,其热力学稳定性逐渐增强,电迁移过程中更难以溶解,抑制晶界扩散通量的增长,进一步阻碍Ni原子的扩散。},

However, there are critical applications, e.g. in the case of power plants, where life may be 20 years or more. While proactive maintenance is normally practiced for mechanical components, we have not found references in the technical literature that address the question as to whether or not proactive maintenance for electronic systems may be warranted in cases of very long term usage. Electronics reliability models that are commonly used include MIL-HDBK 217F (Ref. 1) and Telcordia Reliability model (Ref. 2). In the former model failures are assumed to be "random," i.e. exponentially distributed. A model such as this has no "infant mortality" or "wearout" region. The latter, Telcordia, model does add a "First year multiplier" to account for infant mortality but no factors for well-aged components. Physics of failure approaches (see e.g. Ref. 3) come closest to describing the "life" of electronic products. They are useful in cases where life is limited by predictable physical mechanisms. These models work well, e.g., for the case of solder joint fatigue by thermal cycling. However, POF approaches are not adequate for large systems, with disparate part types, where the environmental conditions are benign. In our applications, units are operated in a control room with carefully controlled environmental conditions. So, we conducted a large measurement program on samples of aged control circuit cards to determine what components age, and by how much, over 20 years or more. We used the results, in concert with additional analysis, to determine a maintenance strategy for older control systems.},

  abstract = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a prominent role in many disciplines of science and engineering. PDEs are commonly derived based on empirical observations. However, with the rapid development of sensors, computational power, and data storage in the past decade, huge quantities of data can be easily collected and efficiently stored. Such vast quantity of data offers new opportunities for data-driven discovery of physical laws. Inspired by the latest development of neural network designs in deep learning, we propose a new feed-forward deep network, called PDE-Net, to fulfill two objectives at the same time: to accurately predict dynamics of complex systems and to uncover the underlying hidden PDE models. Comparing with existing approaches, our approach has the most flexibility by learning both differential operators and the nonlinear response function of the underlying PDE model. A special feature of the proposed PDE-Net is that all filters are properly constrained, which enables us to easily identify the governing PDE models while still maintaining the expressive and predictive power of the network. These constrains are carefully designed by fully exploiting the relation between the orders of differential operators and the orders of sum rules of filters (an important concept originated from wavelet theory). Numerical experiments show that the PDE-Net has the potential to uncover the hidden PDE of the observed dynamics, and predict the dynamical behavior for a relatively long time, even in a noisy environment.},

A sample subset was evaluated up to 1.6 500 h at 25 degrees C and up to 4500 h at 55 degrees C. The test results show that contact resistance decreases over time for all test conditions, as much as 50\% from their initial values. Elastomer contact behavior is strongly dependent on temperature and time. The resistance behavior over temperature is modeled with multiple statistical distributions. The mean contact resistance is represented with a physics-of-failure model, and the elastomer contact reliability is estimated using a log-normal distribution.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in diverse applications; however, its use in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) has emerged only recently. Here, we present an overview of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which embed a PDE into the loss of the neural network using automatic differentiation. The PINN algorithm is simple, and it can be applied to different types of PDEs, including integro-differential equations, fractional PDEs, and stochastic PDEs. Moreover, from an implementation point of view, PINNs solve inverse problems as easily as forward problems. We propose a new residual-based adaptive refinement (RAR) method to improve the training efficiency of PINNs. For pedagogical reasons, we compare the PINN algorithm to a standard finite element method. We also present a Python library for PINNs, DeepXDE, which is designed to serve both as an educational tool to be used in the classroom as well as a research tool for solving problems in computational science and engineering. Specifically, DeepXDE can solve forward problems given initial and boundary conditions, as well as inverse problems given some extra measurements. DeepXDE supports complex-geometry domains based on the technique of constructive solid geometry and enables the user code to be compact, resembling closely the mathematical formulation. We introduce the usage of DeepXDE and its customizability, and we also demonstrate the capability of PINNs and the user-friendliness of DeepXDE for five different examples. More broadly, DeepXDE contributes to the more rapid development of the emerging scientific machine learning field.},

  abstract = {Instrumented indentation has been developed and widely utilized as one of the most versatile and practical means of extracting mechanical properties of materials. This method is particularly desirable for those applications where it is difficult to experimentally determine the mechanical properties using stress-strain data obtained from coupon specimens. Such applications include material processing and manufacturing of small and large engineering components and structures involving the following: three-dimensional (3D) printing, thin-film and multilayered structures, and integrated manufacturing of materials for coupled mechanical and functional properties. Here, we utilize the latest developments in neural networks, including a multifidelity approach whereby deep-learning algorithms are trained to extract elasto-plastic properties of metals and alloys from instrumented indentation results using multiple datasets for desired levels of improved accuracy. We have established algorithms for solving inverse problems by recourse to single, dual, and multiple indentation and demonstrate that these algorithms significantly outperform traditional brute force computations and function-fitting methods. Moreover, we present several multifidelity approaches specifically for solving the inverse indentation problem which 1) significantly reduce the number of high-fidelity datasets required to achieve a given level of accuracy, 2) utilize known physical and scaling laws to improve training efficiency and accuracy, and 3) integrate simulation and experimental data for training disparate datasets to learn and minimize systematic errors. The predictive capabilities and advantages of these multifidelity methods have been assessed by direct comparisons with experimental results for indentation for different commercial alloys, including two wrought aluminum alloys and several 3D printed titanium alloys.},

  abstract = {It is widely known that neural networks (NNs) are universal approximators of continuous functions. However, a less known but powerful result is that a NN with a single hidden layer can accurately approximate any nonlinear continuous operator. This universal approximation theorem of operators is suggestive of the structure and potential of deep neural networks (DNNs) in learning continuous operators or complex systems from streams of scattered data. Here, we thus extend this theorem to DNNs. We design a new network with small generalization error, the deep operator network (DeepONet), which consists of a DNN for encoding the discrete input function space (branch net) and another DNN for encoding the domain of the output functions (trunk net). We demonstrate that DeepONet can learn various explicit operators, such as integrals and fractional Laplacians, as well as implicit operators that represent deterministic and stochastic differential equations. We study different formulations of the input function space and its effect on the generalization error for 16 different diverse applications.},

FBGA packages can warp due to local and global mismatch of the coefficients of thermal expansion and the asymmetric package geometry. Temperature cycling condition including dwell time and ramp rate is an important factor that will affect the solder joins reliability.

Two types of analyses include the physics-based analysis and the statistical-based analysis. The paper presents the physics-based analysis, three steps, uses by DoE tool. The first step we have to select the parameters, such as PCB thickness, PCB Young's modulus, PCB coefficient of temperature expansion (CTE), solder joints height, die thickness, mold compound thickness, and so on. The second step is to find important factors. And the final step is going to DoE, in this paper used response surface methodology (RSM).

The Koopman operator is a leading data-driven embedding, and its eigenfunctions provide intrinsic coordinates that globally linearize the dynamics. However, identifying and representing these eigenfunctions has proven challenging. This work leverages deep learning to discover representations of Koopman eigenfunctions from data. Our network is parsimonious and interpretable by construction, embedding the dynamics on a low-dimensional manifold. We identify nonlinear coordinates on which the dynamics are globally linear using a modified auto-encoder. We also generalize Koopman representations to include a ubiquitous class of systems with continuous spectra. Our framework parametrizes the continuous frequency using an auxiliary network, enabling a compact and efficient embedding, while connecting our models to decades of asymptotics. Thus, we benefit from the power of deep learning, while retaining the physical interpretability of Koopman embeddings.},

Therefore, the effect of residual stresses on failure onset has been considered in these studies to examine their effects on MEMS reliability. Numerical results have shown that failure initiation is strongly influenced by the loading conditions (i.e. different range of temperatures), boundary conditions and finally by the presence of residual stresses.},

"Boot strapping" these methods can provide high confidence cost estimates early in the development cycle. For example, a previous study of the Navy's P-3C fleet showed that a 10 degree (F) increase in equipment rack temperature (due to technology implementation) would decrease the mean time between failure (MTBF) of key components by 18\% (from 4.00 to 3.28 hours) leading to increased annual operating costs of \$19 million (BY1988).

Pre-defined use case studies using modeling and simulation techniques can increase success of the PBR approach.

  abstract = {Lithiated Si anodes facilitate reduction of carbonate additives through multiple electron transfers.           ,                             Solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers are films deposited on the surface of Li-ion battery electrodes during battery charge and discharge processes. They are due to electrochemical instability of the electrolyte which causes electron transfer from (to) the anode (cathode) surfaces. The films could have a protective passivating role and therefore understanding the detailed reduction (oxidation) processes is essential. Here density functional theory and               ab initio               molecular dynamics simulations are used to investigate the reduction mechanisms of vinylene carbonate (VC) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) on lithiated silicon surfaces. These species are frequently used as ``additives'' to improve the SEI properties. It is found that on lithiated Si anodes (with low to intermediate degrees of lithiation) VC may be reduced               via               a 2e               -               mechanism yielding an opened VC               2-               anion. At higher degrees of lithiation, such a species receives two extra electrons from the surface resulting in an adsorbed CO               2-               (ads)               anion and a radical anion \textperiodcentered OC               2               H               2               O               2-               . Additionally, in agreement with experimental observations, it is shown that CO               2               can be generated from reaction of VC with the CO               3               2-               anion, a product of the reduction of the main solvent, ethylene carbonate (EC). On the other hand, FEC reduction on Li               x               Si               y               surfaces is found to be independent of the degree of lithiation, and occurs through three mechanisms. One of them leads to an adsorbed VC               2-               anion upon release from the FEC molecule and adsorption on the surface of F               -               and one H atom. Thus in some cases, the reduction of FEC may lead to the exact same reduction products as that of VC, which explains similarities in SEI layers formed in the presence of these additives. However, FEC may be reduced               via               two other multi-electron transfer mechanisms that result in formation of either CO               2               2-               , F               -               , and \textperiodcentered CH               2               CHO               -               or CO               2-               , F               -               , and \textperiodcentered OCH               2               CHO               -               . These alternative reduction products may oligomerize and form SEI layers with different components than those formed in the presence of VC. In all cases, FEC reduction also leads to formation of LiF moieties on the anode surface, in agreement with reported experimental data. The crucial role of the surface in each of these mechanisms is thoroughly explained.},

The accuracy of posterior estimates is examined with respect to the order of the PC representation, the choice of PC basis, and the decomposition of the support of the prior. The computational cost of the new scheme shows significant gains over direct sampling. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A method for solving boundary value problems (BVPs) is introduced using artificial neural networks (ANNs) for irregular domain boundaries with mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary conditions (BCs). The approximate ANN solution automatically satisfies BCs at all stages of training, including before training commences. This method is simpler than other ANN methods for solving BVPs due to its unconstrained nature and because automatic satisfaction of Dirichlet BCs provides a good starting approximate solution for significant portions of the domain. Automatic satisfaction of BCs is accomplished by the introduction of an innovative length factor. Several examples of BVP solution are presented for both linear and nonlinear differential equations in two and three dimensions. Error norms in the approximate solution on the order of 10(-4) to 10(-5) are reported for all example problems.},

  abstract = {Accelerated degradation testing can be employed when there are measures that relate system health to function or operation. This approach may also be needed when the system life is much longer than the test time available. Degradation might be applied to any component or system that shows change, wear, corrosion, crack growth or fatigue as a failure mechanism that leads to eventual system failure. Thus metals, plastics, batteries, adhesives, semiconductors, insulators, bearings, chemicals, paints, asphalt, solar radiation, drugs, one shot devices, planning for maintenance and even shelf life situations may need degradation approaches. The theory has been described by Meeker (1), Nelson (2) and Lawless (3), but these sources have used simple examples that fit with theory. When sample sizes are small and measurements show variability, the simple theory may be hard to apply. For a single stress at a constant level, being able to measure the degradation in the presence of "noise" can be a challenge. When multilevel stresses are employed, the stress-life relationship may change from a simple linear model at low stress to a non-linear model at high stress. Some degradation tests can involve multiple stresses at discrete levels. In this situation non-linear effects can enter. Analysis becomes more difficult when identifying the causes of any failure modes. Treating multiple stresses as a Design of Experiments can help set up and analysis. A good grounding in Physics of Failure (POF) can help sort out the failure modes and causes as the degradation is monitored. There are limits to the application of accelerated degradation testing and at least seven assumptions for successful use of degradation methods have been identified by papers. A broader list includes: Observed degradation (change) is not reversible when the stress is removed. There is a single or dominate degradation process that can be studied (POF). Any degradation before the start of the accelerated test is negligible. There should be a low error in the ability to measure the degradation (i.e. low variability). The stress remains constant at each stress level of a test. Samples selected are typical of the population before the start of the test. There are no outliers in the sample that lead to unusual behavior. Many processes follow a simple cumulative damage model. The single degradation mechanism leads to unique (single) failure mode. The failure mode observed is a key measure of the health of the sample. When multiple stresses are present behavior is probably non-linear. Basic degradation models include linear degradation, Arrhenius degradation, exponential degradation, power law degradation and the Eyring degradation. The detailed examples of the paper will include an adhesive representing a continuous process, a mechanical actuator as a cyclic stress example and a two stress degradation examples. The paper will cover single and multilevel stress tests as well as one multiple stress example combined with discussion of data analysis and modeling. Several different models will be used in the analysis. Selection of sample size and time of testing will be briefly discussed as will different stress life models.

  abstract = {Multilayer neural networks are among the most powerful models in machine learning, yet the fundamental reasons for this success defy mathematical understanding. Learning a neural network requires optimizing a nonconvex high-dimensional objective (risk function), a problem that is usually attacked using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Does SGD converge to a global optimum of the risk or only to a local optimum? In the former case, does this happen because local minima are absent or because SGD somehow avoids them? In the latter, why do local minima reached by SGD have good generalization properties? In this paper, we consider a simple case, namely two-layer neural networks, and prove that-in a suitable scaling limit-SGD dynamics is captured by a certain nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) that we call distributional dynamics (DD). We then consider several specific examples and show how DD can be used to prove convergence of SGD to networks with nearly ideal generalization error. This description allows for "averaging out" some of the complexities of the landscape of neural networks and can be used to prove a general convergence result for noisy SGD.},

  abstract = {Currently the training of neural networks relies on data of comparable accuracy but in real applications only a very small set of high-fidelity data is available while inexpensive lower fidelity data may be plentiful. We propose a new composite neural network (NN) that can be trained based on multi-fidelity data. It is comprised of three NNs, with the first NN trained using the low-fidelity data and coupled to two high-fidelity NNs, one with activation functions and another one without, in order to discover and exploit nonlinear and linear correlations, respectively, between the low-fidelity and the high-fidelity data. We first demonstrate the accuracy of the new multi-fidelity NN for approximating some standard benchmark functions but also a 20-dimensional function that is not easy to approximate with other methods, e.g. Gaussian process regression. Subsequently, we extend the recently developed physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to be trained with multi-fidelity data sets (MPINNs). MPINNs contain four fully-connected neural networks, where the first one approximates the low-fidelity data, while the second and third construct the correlation between the low- and high-fidelity data and produce the multi-fidelity approximation, which is then used in the last NN that encodes the partial differential equations (PDEs). Specifically, by decomposing the correlation into a linear and nonlinear part, the present model is capable of learning both the linear and complex nonlinear correlations between the low- and high-fidelity data adaptively. By training the MPINNs, we can: (1) obtain the correlation between the low- and high-fidelity data, (2) infer the quantities of interest based on a few scattered data, and (3) identify the unknown parameters in the PDEs. In particular, we employ the MPINNs to learn the hydraulic conductivity field for unsaturated flows as well as the reactive models for reactive transport. The results demonstrate that MPINNs can achieve relatively high accuracy based on a very small set of high-fidelity data. Despite the relatively low dimension and limited number of fidelities (two-fidelity levels) for the benchmark problems in the present study, the proposed model can be readily extended to very high-dimensional regression and classification problems involving multi-fidelity data.

  abstract = {On the basis of extensive studies of synthetic perovskite-structured compounds it is possible to derive a hierarchy of hettotype structures which are derivatives of the arisotypic cubic perovskite structure (ABX3), exemplified by SrTiO3 (tausonite) or KMgF3 ( parascandolaite) by: (1) tilting and distortion of the BX6 octahedra; (2) ordering of A- and B-site cations; (3) formation of A-, B- or X-site vacancies. This hierarchical scheme can be applied to some naturally-occurring oxides, fluorides, hydroxides, chlorides, arsenides, intermetallic compounds and silicates which adopt such derivative crystal structures. Application of this hierarchical scheme to naturally-occurring minerals results in the recognition of a perovskite supergroup which is divided into stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric perovskite groups, with both groups further divided into single ABX3 or double A2BB{${'}$}X6 perovskites. Subgroups, and potential subgroups, of stoichiometric perovskites include: (1) silicate single perovskites of the bridgmanite subgroup; (2) oxide single perovskites of the perovskite subgroup (tausonite, perovskite, loparite, lueshite, isolueshite, lakargiite, megawite); (3) oxide single perovskites of the macedonite subgroup which exhibit second order Jahn-Teller distortions (macedonite, barioperovskite); (4) fluoride single perovskites of the neighborite subgroup (neighborite, parascandolaite); (5) chloride single perovskites of the chlorocalcite subgroup; (6) B-site cation ordered double fluoride perovskites of the cryolite subgroup (cryolite, elpasolite, simmonsite); (7) B-site cation ordered oxide double perovskites of the vapnikite subgroup [vapnikite, (?) latrappite]. Non-stoichiometric perovskites include: (1) A-site vacant double hydroxides, or hydroxide perovskites, belonging to the s\"ohngeite, schoenfliesite and stottite subgroups; (2) Anion-deficient perovskites of the brownmillerite subgroup (srebrodolskite, shulamitite); (3) A-site vacant quadruple perovskites (skutterudite subgroup); (4) B-site vacant single perovskites of the oskarssonite subgroup [oskarssonite]; (5) B-site vacant inverse single perovskites of the cohenite and auricupride subgroups; (6) B-site vacant double perovskites of the diaboleite subgroup; (7) anion-deficient partly-inverse B-site quadruple perovskites of the hematophanite subgroup.},

  abstract = {Lithium\textendash sulfur batteries (Li\textendash S) are considered the most promising systems for next-generation energy storage devices due to their high theoretical energy density and relatively low cost.           ,                             Lithium\textendash sulfur batteries (Li\textendash S) are considered the most promising systems for next-generation energy storage devices due to their high theoretical energy density and relatively low cost. However, the practical applications of Li\textendash S batteries are hindered by the poor electronic conductivity of sulfur and capacity degradation resulting from the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Herein, we demonstrate use of a tin-sulfide (SnS               2               ) modified separator to facilitate the redox reaction involving LiPS intermediates and realize improved electrochemical performance in a Li\textendash S battery. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that SnS               2               exhibits a strong affinity with LiPSs and induces a rapid conversion of trapped polysulfides. As a result, Li\textendash S batteries with a SnS               2               -modified separator exhibited an enhanced specific capacity of 1300 mA h g               -1               at 0.2C (corresponding to a high areal capacity of 4.03 mA h cm               -2               ), which was maintained at 1040 mA h g               -1               after 150 cycles. Furthermore, an excellent rate capability is achieved with a capacity of 700 mA h g               -1               (2.17 mA h cm               -2               ) at 5C. Additionally, the modified separator exhibited excellent cycling performance up to 500 cycles at 2C, with a low capacity decay rate of 0.0710\% per cycle. The excellent performance of the sulfur electrode is mainly attributed to the incorporation of the SnS               2               coating layer on the separator, which effectively confines polysulfides               via               both chemical and physical interaction and rapidly improves lithium ion diffusion. Moreover, the SnS               2               coating layer greatly improves sulfur utilization and efficiently accelerates the kinetic conversion of trapped polysulfides.},

  abstract = {In order to formulate a statistical model of nuclear properties we combine the Thomas-Fermi assumption of two fermions per h3 of phase space with an effective interaction between nucleons that contains seven adjustable parameters. After allowing for shell effects, an even-odd correction and a congruence energy (``Wigner Term''), six of the seven parameters were fitted to 1654 ground state masses of nuclei with N, Z {$>$} 8, together with a constraint that ensures agreement with measured values of the nuclear surface diffuseness. The RMS deviation in the fit to masses was 0.655 MeV, and the calculated values exhibit no drastic discrepancies even for A = 3. Calculated sizes of nuclear charge distributions agree closely with measurements. Calculated fission barriers were compared with 40 measured values down to 75Br. For Z {$>$} 88 the agreement is almost perfect. For Z {$<$} 88 the trend of the measurements seems to confirm the expectation that the congruence energy should double its magnitude for strongly necked-in saddle-point shapes. A seventh (density-dependence) parameter in the effective interaction can be adjusted to ensure fair agreement with the measured energy-dependence of the optical model potential in the range from - 70 MeV to 180 MeV.},

These basis elements are oftentimes found after a laborious process of scientific investigation and plain guesswork. Can this identification problem be facilitated? Is there a general recipe/decision framework for guiding the design of basis elements? We suggest that the answer to the above questions could be positive based on the reformulation of numerical homogenization as a Bayesian inference problem in which a given PDE with rough coefficients (or multiscale operator) is excited with noise (random right-hand side/source term) and one tries to estimate the value of the solution at a given point based on a finite number of observations. We apply this reformulation to the identification of bases for the numerical homogenization of arbitrary integro-differential equations and show that these bases have optimal recovery properties. In particular we show how rough polyharmonic splines can be rediscovered as the optimal solution of a Gaussian filtering problem.},

  abstract = {Learning can be seen as approximating an unknown function by interpolating the training data. Although Kriging offers a solution to this problem, it requires the prior specification of a kernel and it is not scalable to large datasets. We explore a numerical approximation approach to kernel selection/construction based on the simple premise that a kernel must be good if the number of interpolation points can be halved without significant loss in accuracy (measured using the intrinsic RKHS norm parallel to . parallel to associated with the kernel). We first test and motivate this idea on a simple problem of recovering the Green's function of an elliptic PDE (with inhomogeneous coefficients) from the sparse observation of one of its solutions. Next we consider the problem of learning non-parametric families of deep kernels of the form K-1 (F-n (x), F-n (x')) with F-n(+1) = (I-d + epsilon G(n+1)) circle F-n and G(n+1) is an element of span \{K-1 (F-n (x(i)), .)\}. With the proposed approach constructing the kernel becomes equivalent to integrating a stochastic data driven dynamical system, which allows for the training of very deep (bottomless) networks and the exploration of their properties. These networks learn by constructing flow maps in the kernel and input spaces via incremental data-dependent deformations/perturbations (appearing as the cooperative counterpart of adversarial examples) and, at profound depths, they (1) can achieve accurate classification from only one data point per class (2) appear to learn archetypes of each class (3) expand distances between points that are in different classes and contract distances between points in the same class. For kernels parameterized by the weights of Convolutional Neural Networks, minimizing approximation errors incurred by halving random subsets of interpolation points, appears to outperform training (the same CNN architecture) with relative entropy and dropout.

This new numerical homogenization method is based on the transfer of a new metric in addition to traditional averaged (homogenized) quantities from subgrid scales into computational scales.

  abstract = {We introduce a near-linear complexity (geometric and meshless/algebraic) multigrid/multi-resolution method for PDEs with rough (L-infinity) coefficients with rigorous a priori accuracy and performance estimates. The method is discovered through a decision/game theory formulation of the problems of (1) identifying restriction and interpolation operators, (2) recovering a signal from incomplete measurements based on norm constraints on its image under a linear operator, and (3) gambling on the value of the solution of the PDE based on a hierarchy of nested measurements of its solution or source term. The resulting elementary gambles form a hierarchy of (deterministic) basis functions of H-0(1) (Omega) (gamblets) that (1) are orthogonal across subscales/subbands with respect to the scalar product induced by the energy norm of the PDE, (2) enable sparse compression of the solution space in H-0(1) (Omega), and (3) induce an orthogonal multiresolution operator decomposition. The operating diagram of the multigrid method is that of an inverted pyramid in which gamblets are computed locally (by virtue of their exponential decay) and hierarchically (from fine to coarse scales) and the PDE is decomposed into a hierarchy of independent linear systems with uniformly bounded condition numbers. The resulting algorithm is parallelizable both in space (via localization) and in bandwidth/subscale (subscales can be computed independently from each other). Although the method is deterministic, it has a natural Bayesian interpretation under the measure of probability emerging (as a mixed strategy) from the information game formulation, and multiresolution approximations form a martingale with respect to the filtration induced by the hierarchy of nested measurements.},

  abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), introduced in [M. Raissi, P. Perdikaris, and G. Karniadakis, T. Comput. Phys., 378 (2019), pp. 686-707], are effective in solving integer-order partial differential equations (PDEs) based on scattered and noisy data. PINNs employ standard feedforward neural networks (NNs) with the PDEs explicitly encoded into the NN using automatic differentiation, while the sum of the mean-squared PDE residuals and the mean-squared error in initial-boundary conditions is minimized with respect to the NN parameters. Here we extend PINNs to fractional PINNs (fPINNs) to solve space-time fractional advection-diffusion equations (fractional ADEs), and we study systematically their convergence, hence explaining both fPINNs and PINNs for the first time. Specifically, we demonstrate their accuracy and effectiveness in solving multidimensional forward and inverse problems with forcing terms whose values are only known at randomly scattered spatio-temporal coordinates (black-box (BB) forcing terms). A novel element of the fPINNs is the hybrid approach that we introduce for constructing the residual in the loss function using both automatic differentiation for the integer-order operators and numerical discretization for the fractional operators. This approach bypasses the difficulties stemming from the fact that automatic differentiation is not applicable to fractional operators because the standard chain rule in integer calculus is not valid in fractional calculus. To discretize the fractional operators, we employ the Griinwald-Letnikov (GL) formula in one-dimensional fractional ADEs and the vector GL formula in conjunction with the directional fractional Laplacian in two- and three-dimensional fractional ADEs. We first consider the one-dimensional fractional Poisson equation and compare the convergence of the fPINNs against the finite difference method (FDM). We present the solution convergence using both the mean L-2 error as well as the standard deviation due to sensitivity to NN parameter initializations. Using different GL formulas we observe first-, second-, and third-order convergence rates for small size training sets but the error saturates for larger training sets. We explain these results by analyzing the four sources of numerical errors due to discretization, sampling, NN approximation, and optimization. The total error decays monotonically (below 10(-5) for a third-order GL formula) but it saturates beyond that point due to the optimization error. We also analyze the relative balance between discretization and sampling errors and observe that the sampling size and the number of discretization points (auxiliary points) should be comparable to achieve the highest accuracy. As we increase the depth of the NN up to certain value, the mean error decreases and the standard deviation increases, whereas the width has essentially no effect unless its value is either too small or too large. We next consider time-dependent fractional ADEs and compare white-box (WB) and BB forcing. We observe that for the WB forcing, our results are similar to the aforementioned cases; however, for the BB forcing fPINNs outperform FDM. Subsequently, we consider multidimensional time-, space-, and space-time-fractional ADEs using the directional fractional Laplacian and we observe relative errors of 10(-3) similar to 10(-4). Finally, we solve several inverse problems in one, two, and three dimensions to identify the fractional orders, diffusion coefficients, and transport velocities and obtain accurate results given proper initializations even in the presence of significant noise.},

We generalize the current NNGP to first include a larger number of hyperparameters and subsequently train the model by maximum likelihood estimation. Unlike previous works on NNGP that targeted classification, here we apply the generalized NNGP to function approximation and to solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Specifically, we develop an analytical iteration formula to compute the covariance function of GP induced by deep NN with an error-function nonlinearity. We compare the performance of the generalized NNGP for function approximations and PDE solutions with those of GPs and fully-connected NNs. We observe that for smooth functions the generalized NNGP can yield the same order of accuracy with GP, while both NNGP and GP outperform deep NN. For non-smooth functions, the generalized NNGP is superior to GP and comparable or superior to deep NN. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Due to the complex uncertainty of working loads and design parameters, time-dependent reliability estimation is timeconsuming. Various works aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of time-dependent reliability estimation methods with a known time-dependent response of the mechanical system. Time-dependent reliability calculation with complex uncertainty and unknown limit state function are more complex. In this article, surrogate modeling and data clustering technology are utilized to estimate the time-dependent reliability of mechanical structure. First, the physics of failure with respect to time for a mechanical structure is analyzed, and BP neural network is introduced to build the surrogate model of time-dependent response for mechanical structure. Second, data clustering technique is used to find the most probable failure domains. Furthermore, the Genetic Algorithm is utilized to search the extreme values of the response at the most probable failure points during the given time interval. Then, the surrogate model for the extreme values at the most probable failure points is approximately established using BP neural network and Monte Carlo simulation is used for time-dependent reliability estimation. Finally, two examples are presented to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

The mechanics of the system is characterized using surrogate models for stress and metal temperature based on results from multiple non-linear finite element simulations. A cumulative damage index measure has been formulated that quantifies the health of the component. To address deficiencies in the simulation results, a model tuning framework is designed to improve the accuracy of the model. Despite the model tuning, un-modelled sources of variation can lead to insufficient model accuracy. It is required to incorporate these un-modelled effects so as to improve the model performance. A novel machine learning based model fusion approach has been presented that can combine physics model predictions with other data sources that are difficult to incorporate in a physics framework. This approach has been applied to a gas turbine hot section turbine blade failure prediction example.},

  abstract = {This work describes the architecture for developing physics of failure models, derived as a function of machine sensor data, and integrating with data pertaining to other relevant factors like geography, manufacturing, environment, customer and inspection information, that are not easily modeled using physics principles. The mechanics of the system is characterized using surrogate models for stress and metal temperature based on results from multiple non-linear finite element simulations. A cumulative damage index measure has been formulated that quantifies the health of the component. To address deficiencies in the simulation results, a model tuning framework is designed to improve the accuracy of the model. Despite the model tuning, unmodelled sources of variation can lead to insufficient model accuracy. It is required to incorporate these un-modelled effects so as to improve the model performance. A novel machine learning based model fusion approach has been presented that can combine physics model predictions with other data sources that are difficult to incorporate in a physics framework. This approach has been applied to a gas turbine hot section turbine blade failure prediction example.},

CP-SM provides fast inference of spatially resolved three-dimensional (3D) microstructure and micromechanical fields and their evolution during plastic deformation, predicting the 22-dimensional material characteristics including a four-dimensional (4D) quaternion-based representation of crystal orientation, six-dimensional (6D) elastic and plastic strain tensors, and 6D stress at each location in the 3D structure. The predictions from CP-SM are orders of magnitude faster than and show good agreement with the deformation fields predicted by performing direct numerical simulations using spectral solvers. The fidelity of the CP-SM is further tested by assessing how well physics-based constraints are satisfied by the predicted 3D fields. We demonstrate our results on numerical simulations of uniaxially loaded copper.},

  abstract = {Large-scale atomistic computer simulations of materials heavily rely on interatomic potentials predicting the energy and Newtonian forces on atoms. Traditional interatomic potentials are based on physical intuition but contain few adjustable parameters and are usually not accurate. The emerging machine-learning (ML) potentials achieve highly accurate interpolation within a large DFT database but, being purely mathematical constructions, suffer from poor transferability to unknown structures. We propose a new approach that can drastically improve the transferability of ML potentials by informing them of the physical nature of interatomic bonding. This is achieved by combining a rather general physics-based model (analytical bond-order potential) with a neural-network regression. This approach, called the physically informed neural network (PINN) potential, is demonstrated by developing a general-purpose PINN potential for Al. We suggest that the development of physics-based ML potentials is the most effective way forward in the field of atomistic simulations.},

However, the most widely used CH3NH3PbI3 suffers from its poor stability and inclusion of toxic lead. In order to screen potential ABX3 candidate materials for solar cell applications, first-principles calculations have been performed for 90 organic-inorganic ABX3 perovskites with A cation to be one of CH3NH3, CH3CH2NH3 and CH2(NH2)2 molecules, B cation from Cd, Cu, Ge, Mg, Ni, Pb, Sn, Ti, V and Zn, and the X monovalent anion from Cl, Br and I. Some potential absorber materials with a 3D perovskite structure have been identified by using the calculated decomposition enthalpies, band gaps, and optimized atomic structures. The structural factor screening is found to be not decisive since the electronic effects are not taken into account. Furthermore, by doping at the B or X sites with a proper concentration, it is possible to improve the stability and optimize the band gap of perovskite materials. Since the present calculations are conducted for small monovalent organic molecules and the tetragonal perovskites, the present theoretical results should provide a useful guidance for designing the organic-inorganic perovskite solar cell absorbers.},

Intuitively, this property is in line with the observation that over-parameterized networks prioritize learning simple patterns that generalize across data samples. We also investigate the role of the shape of the data manifold by presenting empirical and theoretical evidence that, somewhat counter-intuitively, learning higher frequencies gets easier with increasing manifold complexity.},

Our method circumvents the need for spatial discretization of the differential operators by proper placement of Gaussian process priors. This is an attempt to construct structured and data-efficient learning machines, which are explicitly informed by the underlying physics that possibly generated the observed data.

  abstract = {Optoelectronic properties of CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocubes (NCs) depend strongly on the interaction of the organic passivating molecules with the inorganic crystal. To understand this interaction, we employed a combination of synchrotron-based X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and first-principles density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations. Variable energy XPS elucidated the internal structure of the inorganic part in a layer-by-layer fashion, whereas NMR characterized the organic ligands. Our experimental results confirm that oleylammonium ions act as capping ligands by substituting Cs+ ions from the surface of CsPbBr3 NCs. DFT calculations shows that the substitution mechanism does not require much energy for surface reconstruction and, in contrast, stabilizes the nanocrystal by the formation of three hydrogen bonds between the -NH3+ moiety of oleylammonium and surrounding Br\textendash{} on the surface of NCs. This substitution mechanism and its origin are in stark contrast to the usual adsorption of organic ligands on the surface of typical NCs.},

The next step will be a hybrid modelling approach, coupling physical process models with the versatility of data-driven machine learning.},

Matrix valued kernels are a natural generalization of the common notion of a kernel. We set the theoretical foundations of so called equivariant matrix valued kernels. We work out several properties of equivariant kernels, we give an interpretation of their behavior and show relations to scalar kernels. The notion of ( ir) reducibility of group representations is transferred into the framework of matrix valued kernels. At the end to two exemplary applications are demonstrated. We design a non-linear rotation and translation equivariant filter for 2D-images and propose an invariant object detector based on the generalized Hough transform.},

Recent studies on the subject of reballing have shown the possibility that the removed Pb-free solder ball leaves behind some intermetallic remnants of the Pb-free solder alloy and the Cu from the pads. A modeling approach based on physics of failure (PoF) is presented that quantifies the interactions between different thermal cycles applied to reballed Ball Grid Arrays (BGA) with remnants of the Pb-free solder alloy on the Cu pads. These resulting interactions are compared to backward compatible Sn-3.8Ag-0.7Cu (SAC) balls soldered with eutectic SnPb paste for the same thermal cycles.

The approach is formulated at the microscale, incorporating physical mechanisms of the intermetallics created with Cu, and at the macroscale, capturing the creep phenomenon of the bulk solder as dominant failure driver. Simulation results show that the reballed cases have higher inelastic energy density per cycle averaged over damage volume near the copper pads and that the inelastic energy density is higher across the bulk of the improperly mixed backward compatible solder balls when compared to properly mixed backward compatible solder balls. The results of this study permit extrapolation of laboratory results to field life predictions and to explore the design of accelerated re-balled or backward compatible BGA tests that relate better to application-specific usage environments.},

Mahalanobis Distance (MD) is used as a precursor monitoring technique to obtain a single comparison metric from multiple sensor data to represent anomalies detected in the system.

  abstract = {In situ diagnostics or prognostics of electronics are based on environment monitoring and reliability computation associated to experienced loads. As health assessment is a major concern for improving the maintenance process, it has to be known as soon as possible to be able to react according to the health status prediction. Indeed, the speed needed for failure prediction calculation from the stress monitored to the warning reported is essential to prevent ongoing operation of an electronic system on the way to failure. Real time on-board calculation is then the main objective in order to avoid regular data downloads and ground-based analysis. This paper presents a smart and integrated micro-programmable life consumption monitoring system (LCMS). The latter embeds sensors and on-board processing capabilities for advanced prognostics of printed wired assemblies (PWAs). Based on a methodology using physics of failure (PoF), it can provide, in real time, the life consumption prediction of electronics. The reliability of the LCMS is also tackled before presenting the real monitoring experiment. Finally, the future trend of such monitoring tools is discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {In situ diagnostics or prognostics of electronics are based on environment monitoring and reliability computation associated to experienced loads. As health assessment is a major concern for improving the maintenance process, it has to be known as soon as possible to be able to react according to the health status prediction. Indeed, the speed needed for failure prediction calculation from the stress monitored to the warning reported is essential to prevent ongoing operation of an electronic system on the way to failure. Real time on-board calculation is then the main objective in order to avoid regular data downloads and ground-based analysis. This paper presents a smart and integrated micro-programmable life consumption monitoring system (LCMS). The latter embeds sensors and on-board processing capabilities for advanced prognostics of printed wired assemblies (PWAs). Based on a methodology using physics of failure (PoF), it can provide, in real time, the life consumption prediction of electronics. The reliability of the LCMS is also tackled before presenting the real monitoring experiment. Finally, the future trend of such monitoring tools is discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

I summarize here this point of view, explaining why I think that in a fundamental description of nature we must "forget time", and how this can be done in the classical and in the quantum theory. The idea is to develop a formalism that treats dependent and independent variables on the same footing. In short, I propose to interpret mechanics as a theory of relations between variables, rather than the theory of the evolution of variables in time.},

Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the "alphabet" used to describe those systems.},

To be useful for batteries, high performance solid state electrolyte materials must satisfy many requirements at once, an optimization that is difficult to perform experimentally or with computationally expensive               ab initio               techniques. We first screen 12\,831 lithium containing crystalline solids for those with high structural and chemical stability, low electronic conductivity, and low cost. We then develop a data-driven ionic conductivity classification model using logistic regression for identifying which candidate structures are likely to exhibit fast lithium conduction based on experimental measurements reported in the literature. The screening reduces the list of candidate materials from 12\,831 down to 21 structures that show promise as electrolytes, few of which have been examined experimentally. We discover that none of our simple atomistic descriptor functions alone provide predictive power for ionic conductivity, but a multi-descriptor model can exhibit a useful degree of predictive power. We also find that screening for structural stability, chemical stability and low electronic conductivity eliminates 92.2\% of all Li-containing materials and screening for high ionic conductivity eliminates a further 93.3\% of the remainder. Our screening utilizes structures and electronic information contained in the Materials Project database.},

  abstract = {We present PFNN, a penalty-free neural network method, to efficiently solve a class of second-order boundary-value problems on complex geometries. To reduce the smoothness requirement, the original problem is reformulated to a weak form so that the evaluations of high-order derivatives are avoided. Two neural networks, rather than just one, are employed to construct the approximate solution, with one network satisfying the essential boundary conditions and the other handling the rest part of the domain. In this way, an unconstrained optimization problem, instead of a constrained one, is solved without adding any penalty terms. The entanglement of the two networks is eliminated with the help of a length factor function that is scale invariant and can adapt with complex geometries. We prove the convergence of the PFNN method and conduct numerical experiments on a series of linear and nonlinear second-order boundary-value problems to demonstrate that PFNN is superior to several existing approaches in terms of accuracy, flexibility and robustness.

  abstract = {Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) are deep learning based techniques for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) encountered in computational science and engineering. Guided by data and physical laws, PINNs find a neural network that approximates the solution to a system of PDEs. Such a neural network is obtained by minimizing a loss function in which any prior knowledge of PDEs and data are encoded. Despite its remarkable empirical success in one, two or three dimensional problems, there is little theoretical justification for PINNs. As the number of data grows, PINNs generate a sequence of minimizers which correspond to a sequence of neural networks. We want to answer the question: Does the sequence of minimizers converge to the solution to the PDE? We consider two classes of PDEs: linear second-order elliptic and parabolic. By adapting the Schauder approach and the maximum principle, we show that the sequence of minimizers strongly converges to the PDE solution in C-0. Furthermore, we show that if each minimizer satisfies the initial/boundary conditions, the convergence mode becomes H-1. Computational examples are provided to illustrate our theoretical findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical work that shows the consistency of PINNs.},

PINNs are neural networks that can combine data and physics in the learning process by adding the residuals of a system of partial differential equations to the loss function. Our PINNs is supervised with realistic ultrasonic surface acoustic wave data acquired at a frequency of 5 MHz. The ultrasonic surface wave data is represented as a deformation on the top surface of a metal plate, measured by using the method of laser vibrometry. The PINN is physically informed by the acoustic wave equation and its convergence is sped up using adaptive activation functions. The adaptive activation function uses a trainable hyperparameter, which is optimized to achieve the best performance of the network. The adaptive activation function changes dynamically, involved in the optimization process. The usage of the adaptive activation function significantly improves the convergence, evidently observed in the current study. We use PINNs to estimate the speed of sound of the metal plate, which we do with an error of 1\%, and then, by allowing the speed of sound to be space dependent, we identify and characterize the crack as the positions where the speed of sound has decreased. Our study also shows the effect of sub-sampling of the data on the sensitivity of sound speed estimates. More broadly, the resulting model shows a promising deep neural network model for ill-posed inverse problems.},

  abstract = {Copper is most widely used interconnect material in present silicon microelectronic technologies. As such, multiple interfaces formed by a thin Cu layer and other materials must be engineered to achieve the desired chemical, mechanical, and electrical properties. Adhesion between Cu and the barrier layer, as well as between Cu and the dielectric, is of particular interest, due to its role in controlling interfacial stability and Cu electromigration behavior [1]. This work focuses on understanding how the interface chemistry affects adhesion. Firstprinciples density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to determine chemical adhesion energies of interfaces formed by Cu and various metals considered as a diffusion barrier, including Ta, TiN, and W. Calculations predicted increasing adhesion strength in the order of TiN {$<$} Si-doped TiN {$<$} TaN {$<$} Ta, consistent with wetting experiments done using 100\AA{} thick Cu layer samples. The effects of doping at the interface using light elements (C, N, O) were also determined. Calculations were also done for interfaces of Cu with two different classes of amorphous dielectric materials, i.e. silicon nitride and silicon carbide, for which detailed material characterizations are often difficult and time consuming. Calculations predicted Cu/Si-nitride and Cu/Si-carbide adhesion strengths consistent with 4-pt-bend experiments, including the improvement in adhesion energies when silicon was used to dope the interface. In addition, weaker interfaces provide low-resistance diffusion paths for Cu atoms during electromigration. The first-principles based modeling, validated by select adhesion measurements, provides a predictive approach to effectively determine adhesion strengths and predict electromigration reliability in interconnects.},

  abstract = {High-dimensional PDEs have been a longstanding computational challenge. We propose to solve high-dimensional PDEs by approximating the solution with a deep neural network which is trained to satisfy the differential operator, initial condition, and boundary conditions. Our algorithm is meshfree, which is key since meshes become infeasible in higher dimensions. Instead of forming a mesh, the neural network is trained on batches of randomly sampled time and space points. The algorithm is tested on a class of high-dimensional free boundary PDEs, which we are able to accurately solve in up to 200 dimensions. The algorithm is also tested on a high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE and Burgers' equation. The deep learning algorithm approximates the general solution to the Burgers' equation for a continuum of different boundary conditions and physical conditions (which can be viewed as a high-dimensional space). We call the algorithm a "Deep Galerkin Method (DGM)" since it is similar in spirit to Galerkin methods, with the solution approximated by a neural network instead of a linear combination of basis functions. In addition, we prove a theorem regarding the approximation power of neural networks for a class of quasilinear parabolic PDEs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A framework is introduced that leverages known physics to reduce overfitting in machine learning for scientific applications. The partial differential equation (PDE) that expresses the physics is augmented with a neural network that uses available data to learn a description of the corresponding unknown or unrepresented physics. Training within this combined system corrects for missing, unknown, or erroneously represented physics, including discretization errors associated with the PDE's numerical solution. For optimization of the network within the PDE, an adjoint PDE is solved to provide high-dimensional gradients, and a stochastic adjoint method (SAM) further accelerates training. The approach is demonstrated for large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulence. High-fidelity direct numerical simulations (DNS) of decaying isotropic turbulence provide the training data used to learn sub-filter-scale closures for the filtered Navier-Stokes equations. Out-of-sample comparisons show that the deep learning PDE method outperforms widely-used models, even for filter sizes so large that they become qualitatively incorrect. It also significantly outperforms the same neural network when a priori trained based on simple data mismatch, not accounting for the full PDE. Measures of discretization errors, which are well-known to be consequential in LES, point to the importance of the unified training formulation's design, which without modification corrects for them. For comparable accuracy, simulation runtime is significantly reduced. A relaxation of the typical discrete enforcement of the divergence-free constraint in the solver is also successful, instead allowing the DPM to approximately enforce incompressibility physics. Since the training loss function is not restricted to correspond directly to the closure to be learned, training can incorporate diverse data, including experimental data. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The approach produces a more accurate time-to-failure and system reliability, including better applications to prognosis and health management. A MATLAB simulation was designed to model the PoF of a particular multi-component system, where the underlying degradation failure mechanisms served as the coupling common cause failure mechanisms (CCCFM). The simulator developed to test this Common Cause Physics of Failure (CCPoF) model was demonstrated using a two-component system. The simulator required identification of failure mechanisms, where the temperature-based failures CCCFM Arrhenius life-stress model served as an example. The simulator randomly generated realizations of CCCFM component failure times and the time of failure of the system itself. Finally, the traditional timebased beta factor common cause failure (CCF) model and system failure probability were obtained for comparison to the CCPoF approach. This simulation procedure was repeated for several levels of ambient temperature to determine any relevant trends and findings. A comparison of the CCPoF-based simulation of this system's reliability with the various forms of the beta factor parametric CCF models shows that the PoF-based common cause failure has many advantages. The parametric CCF model has broad applications and is comparatively simple to use but it is time-independent (i.e., CCF probability is the same throughout life). By contrast, the CCPoF model is more complex but can account for the time dependency of the CCF beta factor when considering aging and degradation in components.

  abstract = {In this paper we first recall the recent result that in deep networks a phase transition, analogous to the jamming transition of granular media, delimits the over- and under-parametrized regimes where fitting can or cannot be achieved. The analysis leading to this result support that for proper initialization and architectures, in the whole over-parametrized regime poor minima of the loss are not encountered during training, because the number of constraints that hinders the dynamics is insufficient to allow for the emergence of stable minima. Next, we study systematically how this transition affects generalization properties of the network (i.e. its predictive power). As we increase the number of parameters of a given model, starting from an under-parametrized network, we observe for gradient descent that the generalization error displays three phases: (i) initial decay, (ii) increase until the transition point?where it displays a cusp?and (iii) slow decay toward an asymptote as the network width diverges. However if early stopping is used, the cusp signaling the jamming transition disappears. Thereby we identify the region where the classical phenomenon of over-fitting takes place as the vicinity of the jamming transition, and the region where the model keeps improving with increasing the number of parameters, thus organizing previous empirical observations made in modern neural networks.},

(7) Reliability evaluations and assurances cannot be delayed until the product is fabricated and shipped to the customer, i.e., cannot be left to the PHM stage: it is too late at this stage to change the design or the materials for improved reliability; that is why, when high reliability is critical (e.g., in the aerospace and military electronics), users have to re-qualify devices to assess their (remaining) useful lifetime (RUL) and to use redundancy in an attempt to build a reliable system out of insufficiently reliable components.

  abstract = {Two advanced probabilistic design-for-reliability (PDfR) concepts are addressed and discussed in application to the prediction, quantification and assurance of the aerospace electronics reliability: 1) Boltzmann-Arrhenius-Zhurkov (BAZ) model, which is an extension of the currently widely used Arrhenius model and, in combination with the exponential law of reliability, enables one to obtain a simple, easy-to-use and physically meaningful formula for the evaluation of the probability of failure (PoF) of a material or a device after the given time in operation at the given temperature and under the given stress (not necessarily mechanical), and 2) Extreme Value Distribution (EVD) technique that can be used to assess the number of repetitive loadings that result in the material/device degradation and eventually lead to its failure by closing, in a step-wise fashion, the gap between the bearing capacity (stress-free activation energy) of the material or the device and the demand (loading). It is shown that the material degradation (aging, damage accumulation, flaw propagation, etc.) can be viewed, when BAZ model is considered, as a Markovian process, and that the BAZ model can be obtained as the ultimate steady-state solution to the well-known Fokker-Planck equation in the theory of Markovian processes. It is shown also that the BAZ model addresses the worst, but a reasonably conservative, situation. It is suggested therefore that the transient period preceding the condition addressed by the steady-state BAZ model need not be accounted for in engineering evaluations. However, when there is an interest in understanding the transient degradation process, the obtained solution to the Fokker-Planck equation can be used for this purpose. As to the EVD concept, it attributes the degradation process to the accumulation of damages caused by a train of repetitive high-level loadings, while loadings of levels that are considerably lower than their extreme values do not contribute appreciably to the finite lifetime of a material or a device. In our probabilistic risk management (PRM) based analysis we treat the stress-free activation energy (capacity) as a normally distributed random variable, and choose, for the sake of simplicity, the (single-parametric) Rayleigh law as the basic distribution underlying the EVD. The general concepts addressed and discussed are illustrated by numerical examples. It is concluded that the application of the PDfR approach and particularly the above two advanced models should be considered as a natural, physically meaningful, informative, comprehensive, and insightful technique that reflects well the physics underlying the degradation processes in materials, devices and systems. It is the author's belief that they will be widely used in engineering practice, when high reliability is imperative, and the ability to quantify it is highly desirable.},

To efficiently design functional electrolytes for lithium batteries, it is particularly important to understand the relative solvating ability of each individual organic solvent, because most of the electrolyte systems are comprised of two or more electrolyte solvents. Using a newly developed internally referenced diffusion-ordered spectroscopy technique and diffusion coefficient\textendash coordination ratio (               D               \textendash{}               {$\alpha$}               ) analysis, we successfully constructed a solvating power series for common electrolyte solvents. We demonstrated the usefulness of this solvating power series in designing more reliable electrolyte system by selecting an appropriate fluorinated electrolyte solvent for a high-voltage lithium metal battery (LMB) as an example. For a methyl(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)carbonate-based electrolyte, we identified fluoroethylene carbonate as a more desirable cyclic carbonate co-solvent than difluoroethylene carbonate for LMB due to its significantly higher ability to solvate lithium ions.},

The molecule\textendash cage interaction influences phase stability, phase transformations, and the molecular dynamics. We examine the hydrogen bonding in four AmBX3 formate perovskites: [Am]Zn(HCOO)3, with Am+ = hydrazinium (NH2NH3+), guanidinium (C(NH2)3+), dimethylammonium (CH3)2NH2+, and azetidinium (CH2)3NH2+. We develop a scheme to quantify the strength of hydrogen bonding in these systems from first-principles, which separates the electrostatic interactions between the amine (Am+) and the BX3\textendash{} cage. The hydrogen-bonding strengths of formate perovskites range from 0.36 to 1.40 eV/cation (8\textendash 32 kcalmol\textendash 1). Complementary solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirms that strong hydrogen bonding hinders cation mobility. Application of the procedure to hybrid lead halide perovskites (X = Cl, Br, I, Am+ = CH3NH3+, CH(NH2)2+) shows that these compounds have significantly weaker hydrogen-bonding energies of 0.09 to 0.27 eV/cation (2\textendash 6 kcalmol\textendash 1), correlating with lower order\textendash disorder transition temperatures.},

We propose Equivariant Transformers (ETs), a family of differentiable image-to-image mappings that improve the robustness of models towards pre-defined continuous transformation groups. Through the use of specially-derived canonical coordinate systems, ETs incorporate functions that are equivariant by construction with respect to these transformations. We show empirically that ETs can be flexibly composed to improve model robustness towards more complicated transformation groups in several parameters. On a real-world image classification task, ETs improve the sample efficiency of ResNet classifiers, achieving relative improvements in error rate of up to 15\% in the limited data regime while increasing model parameter count by less than 1\%.},

In this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN) based method is developed for achieving more accurate remaining useful life prediction of equipment subject to condition monitoring. The ANN model takes the age and multiple condition monitoring measurement values at the present and previous inspection points as the inputs, and the life percentage as the output. A function generalized from the Weibull failure rate function is used to fit each condition monitoring measurement series for a failure history, and the fitted measurement values are used to form the ANN training set so as to reduce the effects of the noise factors that are irrelevant to the equipment degradation. A validation mechanism is introduced in the ANN training process to improve the prediction performance of the ANN model. The proposed ANN method is validated using real-world vibration monitoring data collected from pump bearings in the field. A comparative study is performed between the proposed ANN method and an adapted version of a reported method, and the results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method in achieving more accurate remaining useful life prediction.},

  abstract = {Artificial neural network (ANN) methods have shown great promise in achieving more accurate equipment remaining useful life prediction. However, most reported ANN methods only utilize condition monitoring data from failure histories, and ignore data obtained from suspension histories in which equipments are taken out of service before they fail. Suspension history condition monitoring data contain useful information revealing the degradation of equipment, and will help to achieve more accurate remaining useful life prediction if properly used, particularly when there are very limited failure histories, which is the case in many applications. In this paper, we develop an ANN approach utilizing both failure and suspension condition monitoring histories. The ANN model uses age and condition monitoring data as inputs and the life percentage as output. For each suspension history, the optimal predicted life is determined which can minimize the validation mean square error in the training process using the suspension history and the failure histories. Then the ANN is trained using the failure histories and all the suspension histories with the obtained optimal predicted life values, and the trained ANN can be used for remaining useful life prediction of other equipments. The key idea behind this approach is that the underlying relationship between the inputs and output of ANN is the same for all failure and suspension histories, and thus the optimal life for a suspension history is the one resulting in the lowest ANN validation error. The proposed approach is validated using vibration monitoring data collected from pump bearings in the field.},

  abstract = {现代科学技术的飞速发展带来了全球信息化时代,促进了电子工业的蓬勃发展,对集成电路能够承载的功能提出更高的要求。超摩尔定律的提出指明了电子封装微型化及高密度化的发展方向,使得封装系统中互连焊点的尺寸持续减小,其能够承受的电流密度和焦耳热呈指数增加,导致电迁移成为引发封装系统失效的关键可靠性问题之一。同时,集成电路复杂性的增加又导致封装体中互连焊点的数量急剧上升,因此,互连焊点电迁移可靠性的研究具有重要意义。Sn基无铅焊点中通常包含有限数目的Sn晶粒,其体心四方结构具有强烈的各向异性,因此,会导致焊点严重的电迁移极化现象,造成焊点的提前失效。细化焊点中的Sn晶粒是一种能够降低各向异性对焊点性能影响的有效方法之一,对于焊点的电迁移行为具有缓解作用。因此,研究Sn基多晶焊点生长形成机制,以及包含不同Sn晶粒数目焊点的电迁移行为对提高焊点电迁移可靠性具有十分重要的意义。本文首先通过分析Sn基多晶焊点的晶体生长模型,进而阐述其对提高焊点电迁移可靠性的影响。另一方面,通过调控焊点基体中金属间化合物(IMC),从而缓解金属元素的迁移,是另一种能够提高焊点电迁移可靠性的有效方法。由于实际应用的电子封装中通常采用Au/Ni/Cu作为焊点焊盘,焊点基体中形成的IMC与Cu焊盘焊点中的Cu-Sn相IMC不同,并且基体中IMC种类随着钎料和焊盘金属化层的不同而发生变化,其中Au-Sn相和Au-Sn-In相电迁移行为与Cu-Sn相存在较大差异,不同金属元素在焊点电迁移过程中的影响机制往往被忽视。因此,本文研究了不同种类IMCs对Sn基焊点电迁移行为的影响规律,提出了In元素通过细化原有IMC达到抑制焊点电迁移行为的微观机理。本文的主要研究内容和结论如下:(1)研究了不同冷却速率对Sn基焊点中Sn晶粒细化的机制。建立了In元素引导Sn晶体以交错孪晶(Interlace twins)的方式相互交错的生长模型。In元素影响Sn晶体的生长方式,使相互交错的Sn晶粒之间形成多为60\textdegree 的孪晶界。同时,Bi和In元素能够有效降低Sn-Ag基钎料的熔点,并增大其过冷度。在冷却速率为3.43\textcelsius/s的条件下,选取Sn3.0Ag0.5Cu、Sn3.0Ag3.0Bi、Sn3.0Ag3.0In、Sn3.0Ag3.0Bi3.0In四种钎料,通过分析相应焊点中的Sn晶粒数目和晶界类型,表明Bi和In元素的加入能够提高Sn晶粒的临界形核驱动力,为Sn晶粒提供更多的形核质点,利于多晶焊点的形成。此外,通过对3.43\textcelsius/s和81.67\textcelsius/s两种冷却速率条件下Sn3.0Ag0.5Cu和Sn3.0Ag3.0Bi3.0In焊点微观组织结构的分析,研究了不同冷却速率对Sn晶粒形成的影响。结果表明提高冷却速率可以增大钎料过冷度,提高形核率,抑制Sn晶粒的长大,减小Sn晶粒平均面积,提出了基于提高冷却速率能够稳定细化Sn晶粒形成多晶焊点的工艺路线。(2)通过对具有不同Sn晶体取向焊点电迁移行为的分析,研究了Sn晶粒c轴轴向以及c轴与电子运动方向夹角(\texttheta )对焊点电迁移行为的影响机制。研究表明,Sn晶粒c轴轴向决定焊点中Cu原子的迁移扩散方向,从而影响Cu-Sn相IMC的生长行为。c轴轴向指向焊点观察面时,Cu原子向焊点表面扩散堆积形成Cu-Sn相,反之则Cu原子则向焊点基体内部运动,Cu-Sn相不出现在焊点观察面。其次,夹角\texttheta 影响Cu原子的扩散系数。当Sn晶粒c轴轴向一致时,\texttheta 角越小,Cu原子的扩散系数越大,Cu-Sn相生长越快速,正极界面IMC层厚度增长速率越快,电迁移现象严重。建立了\texttheta 角与Cu-Sn相及IMC层生长速率之间的关系,阐明了Sn晶粒c轴轴向和\texttheta 角对焊点正极界面IMC层和基体内IMC的影响机制。(3)揭示了细化Sn晶粒对提高焊点电迁移可靠性的作用机制。以焊点基体中Cu-Sn相生长行为作为研究对象,通过对单晶焊点、双晶粒焊点、以及多晶粒交错孪晶焊点电迁移行为的研究,表明焊点中Sn晶粒数目增多能够有效缓解Sn基焊点的电迁移行为,降低Sn晶粒各向异性对焊点性能的影响,减少极化效应的产生。同时根据晶界能量理论,孪晶能量低,稳定性高,验证了高密度的孪晶界对于Cu原子及电子具有明显的散射和阻碍作用,避免基体中Cu-Sn相的聚集,阻碍Cu原子的长程定向迁移。(4)结合不同Sn晶粒数目及晶界类型对焊点中Cu-Sn相IMC电迁移行为影响规律研究,阐明了In元素通过细化Au-Sn相IMC进而提高焊点电迁移可靠性的微观强化机理。Au-Sn相IMC的电迁移行为受Sn晶粒各向异性的影响较大,只能靠孪晶界缓解焊点的电迁移行为。Au-Sn-In相IMC在电流应力作用下发生了由针状向非连续颗粒状的相变过程其电迁移行为不受Sn晶粒各向异性的影响。结合STEM观察手段,分析了Au-Sn和Au-Sn-In相IMC的微观结构演变。结果表明,In元素降低了Au元素在Sn中的溶解度,发生相变生成了具有更低生成焓的另一种Au-Sn-In相,晶格结构由Au Sn\_4变为Au In\_2。IMC的形态由致密态向疏松态发生转变,以Au元素包裹Au-Sn-In相存在。由于IMC由针状转变为多个非连续颗粒状,增加了第二相颗粒数量,强烈阻碍电迁移过程中原子的迁移,从而缓解焊点的电迁移行为。},

  abstract = {Prediction of spatiotemporal chaotic systems is important in various fields, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP). While data assimilation methods have been applied in NWP, machine learning techniques, such as reservoir computing (RC), have recently been recognized as promising tools to predict spatiotemporal chaotic systems. However, the sensitivity of the skill of the machine-learning-based prediction to the imperfectness of observations is unclear. In this study, we evaluate the skill of RC with noisy and sparsely distributed observations. We intensively compare the performances of RC and local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) by applying them to the prediction of the Lorenz 96 system. In order to increase the scalability to larger systems, we applied a parallelized RC framework. Although RC can successfully predict the Lorenz 96 system if the system is perfectly observed, we find that RC is vulnerable to observation sparsity compared with LETKF. To overcome this limitation of RC, we propose to combine LETKF and RC. In our proposed method, the system is predicted by RC that learned the analysis time series estimated by LETKF. Our proposed method can successfully predict the Lorenz 96 system using noisy and sparsely distributed observations. Most importantly, our method can predict better than LETKF when the process-based model is imperfect.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art computer codes for simulating real physical systems are often characterized by vast number of input parameters. Performing uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks with Monte Carlo (MC) methods is almost always infeasible because of the need to perform hundreds of thousands or even millions of forward model evaluations in order to obtain convergent statistics. One, thus, tries to construct a cheap-to-evaluate surrogate model to replace the forward model solver. For systems with large numbers of input parameters, one has to address the curse of dimensionality through suitable dimensionality reduction techniques. A popular class of dimensionality reduction methods are those that attempt to recover a low-dimensional representation of the high-dimensional feature space. However, such methods often tend to overestimate the intrinsic dimensionality of the input feature space. In this work, we demonstrate the use of deep neural networks (DNN) to construct surrogate models for numerical simulators. We parameterize the structure of the DNN in a manner that lends the DNN surrogate the interpretation of recovering a low-dimensional nonlinear manifold. The model response is a parameterized nonlinear function of the low-dimensional projections of the input. We think of this lowdimensional manifold as a nonlinear generalization of the notion of the active subspace. Our approach is demonstrated with a problem on uncertainty propagation in a stochastic elliptic partial differential equation (SPDE) with uncertain diffusion coefficient. We deviate from traditional formulations of the SPDE problem by lifting the assumption of fixed lengthscales of the uncertain diffusion field. Instead we attempt to solve a more challenging problem of learning a map between an arbitrary snapshot of the diffusion field and the response. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The CH3NH3PbI3 (methylammonium lead triiodide) perovskite semiconductor system has been viewed as a blockbuster research material during the last five years. Because of its complicated architecture, several of its technological, physical and geometrical issues have been examined many times. Yet this has not assisted in overcoming a number of problems in the field nor in enabling the material to be marketed. For instance, these studies have not clarified the nature and type of hydrogen bonding and other noncovalent interactions involved; the origin of hysteresis; the actual role of the methylammonium cation; the nature of polarity associated with the tetragonal geometry; the unusual origin of various frontier orbital contributions to the conduction band minimum; the underlying phenomena of spin-orbit coupling that causes significant bandgap reduction; and the nature of direct-to-indirect bandgap transition features. Arising from many recent reports, it is now a common belief that the I{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}H\textendash N interaction formed between the inorganic framework and the ammonium group of CH3NH3+ is the only hydrogen bonded interaction responsible for all temperature-dependent geometrical polymorphs of the system, including the most stable one that persists at low-temperatures, and the significance of all other noncovalent interactions has been overlooked. This study focussed only on the low temperature orthorhombic polymorph of CH3NH3PbI3 and CD3ND3PbI3, where D refers deuterium. Together with QTAIM, DORI and RDG based charge density analyses, the results of density functional theory calculations with PBE with and without van der Waals corrections demonstrate that the prevailing view of hydrogen bonding in CH3NH3PbI3 is misleading as it does not alone determine the a-b+a- tilting pattern of the PbI64- octahedra. This study suggests that it is not only the I{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}H/D\textendash N, but also the I{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}H/D\textendash C hydrogen/deuterium bonding and other noncovalent interactions (viz. tetrel-, pnictogen- and lump-hole bonding interactions) that are ubiquitous in the orthorhombic CH3NH3PbI3/CD3ND3PbI3 perovskite geometry. Their interplay determines the overall geometry of the polymorph, and are therefore responsible in part for the emergence of the functional optical properties of this material. This study also suggests that these interactions should not be regarded as the sole determinants of octahedral tilting since lattice dynamics is known to play a critical role as well, a common feature in many inorganic perovskites both in the presence and the absence of the encaged cation, as in CsPbI3/WO3 perovskites, for example.},

However, various challenges, such as dendrite growth, volume change and low coulombic efficiency, have limited the practical applications of Li metal anodes. Herein, we report a 3D porous Cu current collector with a unique biporous and bicontinuous structure fabricated               via               a phase inversion tape casting method. It has two types of pores: ``finger-like'' pores, serving as microchannels for efficient electrolyte and Li ion diffusion, and random small pores, serving as ``cages'' to accommodate Li deposits. Moreover, the high areal current density can be dissipated remarkably because of the large surface area, resulting in a stable solid electrolyte interphase and dendrite-free anode. The as-prepared porous Cu current collector maintains stable performance and ultra-low voltage hysteresis for over 2000 h in symmetric cells and maintains a CE of 97.6\% for 200 cycles in half cells. The porous Cu@Li//LiFePO               4               full cells also present excellent cycling and rate performances. In addition, the phase inversion method is very suitable for mass production, indicating great potential for practical applications of Li metal anodes.},

  abstract = {水是自然界中广泛分布的物质,其参与众多的物理、化学过程,并为生化反应等提供基本的环境。从原子水平认识水体系的存在形式、性质及行为对于从本质上理解相关领域的基本问题意义重大。水的微观形态可被一般性的看作是由水分子通过分子间氢键相互作用彼此聚集而形成的氢键网络体系,而不同尺寸的水团簇即是氢键网络的基本单元。水团簇的结构自由度及氢键网络的复杂行为使得微观水体系的性质不止局限于水分子自身的属性,而同时可以体现出团簇结构随尺寸和对称性的演化特性,以及通过氢键网络实现的构象转变、质子转移等过程。水分子间的氢键决定了氢键体系的结构属性并与水分子自身的电子结构密切相关,近年的实验观测更表明分子间氢键具有与共价键类似的电子结构,这暗示从电子结构角度出发针对水团簇体系进行系统性的理论研究可能为上述水氢键体系的性质与行为提供基础层次的理解。同时,水氢键体系的质子转移问题在各学科及相互间兴趣交叉的研究领域,也占有重要位置。本文使用量子力学第一性原理方法,从电子结构角度出发报道了对水团簇进行的系统性研究。我们分别阐述了水分子间氢键类共价特性的分子轨道表现、小尺寸环状水团簇的离域电子结构特性、环状水团簇中离域分子轨道与其几何结构平面化间的关联、水团簇中心四配位水分子的四氢键电子结构在中等尺寸水团簇中随尺寸变化的趋势,以及棱柱水团簇协同质子转移过程中的手性转变与识别这五个方面的内容。首先,我们选取水二聚物(H2O)2这一基本模型应用高精度第一性原理计算方法,从分子轨道角度出发研究了水分子间氢键的类共价特性。分子轨道分析发现了两条贯穿氢键区域的分子轨道,其贡献主要来自于氢键供体一侧的氧原子2p轨道。进一步的能量分解分析表明两个水分子之间存在不可忽略的诱导作用,其在两水分子相互作用能总吸引项中的比例高于10\%,这进一步支持了氢键的类共价特性。这一研究对理解冰、液态水、功能化材料以及生物系统中的氢键相互作用提供了新的分子轨道视角,并为本文基于电子结构来研究水团簇及氢键网络提供了基础指引。第二,准平面小水环(H2O)n(n=3-6)是构成更为复杂三维水团簇和液态水模型的的基本结构和功能单元,进一步理解分子间氢键相互作用在其中的特点对于认识复杂水团簇及氢键网络的性质具有基础性意义。我们应用密度泛函理论结合键特性分析方法,研究了这类小尺寸环状水团簇,结果表明n=3和4的两种小水环均出现离域于整个环并覆盖环中心区域的离域分子轨道,其贡献来自于各个水分子的氢氧原子,而在n=5和6的水环中相应离域轨道在环中心区域的轨道分布减弱。环状水团簇中的离域电子结构扩展了对水团簇中分子间氢键的认识,其展示的分子间氢键电子结构与体系几何结构间的相互影响及其随尺寸变化的特性为后续工作提供了指引。第三,承接上一研究,我们继续探索了n=3-6的小尺寸环状水团簇(H2O)n中离域电子结构与其几何结构平面化之间的联系。结果表明离域于水环氢键骨架中的三种离域分子轨道与体系能否形成稳定的平面结构密切相关,它们分别为轨道(I),主要由氧原子的孤对电子轨道O(2p)组成的分子轨道;轨道(II),主要由O(2p)-H(1s)形成的沿氢键方向的成键轨道;以及轨道(III),主要由O(2s)-H(1s)形成的成键轨道。当水环几何结构为平面结构时,利于水分子单体轨道之间针对这三种离域轨道实现彼此重叠最大化。进一步的能量分解分析显示,在所有的水环中轨道项的贡献在相互作用能总吸引项中的比例多于30\%,这再一次凸显了氢键系统的类共价特性。第四,基于对小尺寸水团簇的基本认识及研究中体现出的氢键电子结构随尺寸变化的规律,同时面向水团簇作为液态水静态模型时需要考虑的尺寸效应等问题,我们研究了接近液态水中水分子性质的4-配位水分子在团簇(H2O)n(n=17,19,20,21,23,25)中形成的四氢键电子结构,随团簇尺寸变化的趋势。结果表明,中心4-配位水分子与其最近邻水分子之间的相互作用随着团簇水分子数增多而减弱,中心4-配位水分子与次近邻水分子之间的相互作用能随着水分子数目的增多而增强。这表明中心4-配位水分子同最近邻和次近邻水分子之间的相互作用存在竞争关系。而光谱和电子密度分析表明中心水分子参与的最低频分子间振动与其和水笼之间的电子得失没有明显的尺寸依赖变化。此外,中心4-配位水分子四氢键电子结构的类共价特性被拓扑分析进一步阐明。我们希望这一理论研究能够为中等尺寸水团簇的研究及理解液态水中的氢键相互作用提供基本的理论参考。最后,基于以上基础认识,我们进一步探究了氢键网络中的动态过程。沿氢键的质子转移和手性转换过程是物理学及其与生命科学、材料科学等学科交叉领域的基本问题。其在手性识别、酶催化和药物制备等化工生产方面也具有重要意义。在本部分工作中,我们在理论上研究了可看作双层水环的小棱柱水团簇中单层内质子协同转移过程的手性转换和识别问题。结果表明,虽然质子转移初末态的能量变化很小,仅约为0.3 kcal/mol,但是振动圆二色谱(VCD)却提供了一个明显的手性特征峰区域(3000\textasciitilde 3500 cm-1),可以用来区别具有手性特征的初末态水团簇结构。这个区域的振动模式对应于层内氢键的拉伸,而且该区域的振动模式在红外和拉曼光谱中也具有易于观测的较强信号。另外,电子圆二色性谱(ECD)也展示了类似的识别特性。进一步的分子轨道分析显示,涉及两层间相互作用的轨道主要源于氧原子的2p轨道,并且层内协同质子转移过程可使相应层间轨道的能级抬升0.1 e V。此外,我们的研究还发现,氘原子的同位素取代能够在VCD谱上引起明显的特征峰移动,进而为可能的水团簇手性识别的实验探测提供了原理性设计思路。希望我们的发现能够在原子水平上为水团簇手性概念的夯实,乃至手性识别观测在相应实验过程中的实现起到促进作用。},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations provide theoretical insight into the microscopic behavior of condensed-phase materials and, as a predictive tool, enable computational design of new compounds. However, because of the large spatial and temporal scales of thermodynamic and kinetic phenomena in materials, atomistic simulations are often computationally infeasible. Coarse-graining methods allow larger systems to be simulated by reducing their dimensionality, propagating longer timesteps, and averaging out fast motions. Coarse-graining involves two coupled learning problems: defining the mapping from an all-atom representation to a reduced representation, and parameterizing a Hamiltonian over coarse-grained coordinates. We propose a generative modeling framework based on variational auto-encoders to unify the tasks of learning discrete coarse-grained variables, decoding back to atomistic detail, and parameterizing coarse-grained force fields. The framework is tested on a number of model systems including single molecules and bulk-phase periodic simulations.},

  abstract = {Free boundary problems appear naturally in numerous areas of mathematics, science and engineering. These problems present a great computational challenge because they necessitate numerical methods that can yield an accurate approximation of free boundaries and complex dynamic interfaces. In this work, we propose a multi-network model based on physics-informed neural networks to tackle a general class of forward and inverse free boundary problems called Stefan problems. Specifically, we approximate the unknown solution as well as any moving boundaries by two deep neural networks. Besides, we formulate a new type of inverse Stefan problems that aim to reconstruct the solution and free boundaries directly from sparse and noisy measurements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a series of benchmarks spanning different types of Stefan problems, and illustrate how the proposed framework can accurately recover solutions of partial differential equations with moving boundaries and dynamic interfaces.

Our results, using the non-local optB86b + vdWDF functional, excellently agree with the experimental data. Thus, consideration of weak van der Waals interactions is demonstrated to be important for the accurate description of the properties of this type of organic\textendash inorganic hybrid materials. Further analysis of the electronic properties reveals that I 5p electrons can be photo-excited to Pb 6p empty states. The main interaction between the organic cations and the inorganic framework is through the ionic bonding between CH3 and I ions. Furthermore, I atoms in the Pb\textendash I framework are found to be chemically inequivalent because of their different chemical environments.},

This study proposes a forewarning method for insulation condition monitoring of form-wound windings based on partial discharge (PD) and deep learning neural network. Three PD features are extracted from the PD profile, which provides information about physics-of-failure and reflects the degree of insulation degradation. An algorithm fusion extracted from auto-encoder and long short-term recurrent neural network is proposed to synthesize one failure precursor from these three features and make multi-time-step prediction through historical data to provide forewarning. An electrical and thermal accelerated ageing test is performed on the form-wound windings at 0.2 atm to simulate working environment of electric aircraft. The proposed method is validated on the accelerated ageing dataset and shows better prediction accuracy than some existing time-series prediction methods, indicating the advantages of the proposed method. Moreover, an on-line hardware setup using a deep learning processor is recommended to implement the forewarning method. The proposed approach has the potential to be widely applied to other insulation systems and contribute to work on condition monitoring.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study a multi-scale deep neural network (MscaleDNN) as a meshless numerical method for computing oscillatory Stokes flows in complex domains. The MscaleDNN employs a multi-scale structure in the design of its DNN using radial scalings to convert the approximation of high frequency components of the highly oscillatory Stokes solution to one of lower frequencies. The MscaleDNN solution to the Stokes problem is obtained by minimizing a loss function in terms of L-2 norm of the residual of the Stokes equation. Three forms of loss functions are investigated based on vorticity-velocity-pressure, velocity-stress-pressure, and velocity-gradient of velocity-pressure formulations of the Stokes equation. We first conduct a systematic study of the MscaleDNN methods with various loss functions on the Kovasznay flow in comparison with normal fully connected DNNs. Then, Stokes flows with highly oscillatory solutions in a 2-D domain with six randomly placed holes are simulated by the MscaleDNN. The results show that MscaleDNN has faster convergence and consistent error decays in the simulation of Kovasznay flow for all three tested loss functions. More importantly, the MscaleDNN is capable of learning highly oscillatory solutions when the normal DNNs fail to converge.},

  abstract = {As the central component of rotating machine, the performance reliability assessment and remaining useful lifetime prediction of bearing are of crucial importance in condition-based maintenance to reduce the maintenance cost and improve the reliability. A prognostic algorithm to assess the reliability and forecast the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) of bearings was proposed, consisting of three phases. Online vibration and temperature signals of bearings in normal state were measured during the manufacturing process and the most useful time-dependent features of vibration signals were extracted based on correlation analysis (feature selection step). Time series analysis based on neural network, as an identification model, was used to predict the features of bearing vibration signals at any horizons (feature prediction step). Furthermore, according to the features, degradation factor was defined. The proportional hazard model was generated to estimate the survival function and forecast the RUL of the bearing (RUL prediction step). The positive results show that the plausibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach can facilitate bearing reliability estimation and RUL prediction.},

  abstract = {In transportation fields, safety, efficiency, and reliability of engines are primary concerns. Remaining useful life (RUL) estimation technology is used to assess the current health status and make effective maintenance plans for engines. How to estimate RUL accurately to increasing the reliability and safety of systems is a challenge issue. However, the existing estimation methods focus on single size sequence. To address it, this paper proposes a remaining useful life prediction model based on hybrid long-short sequences for engines. For long sequence, long shortterm memory neural network is used to predict RUL by mining smoothed data potential association rules. For short sequence, time window is used to determine the size of short-term sequence, and a direct relation between engine state and RUL is modeled by gradient boosting regression. Finally, back propagation neural network is used to analyze the RUL results of long sequence and short sequence to obtain hybrid sequence prediction result. The proposed model is implemented in a turbofan engine degradation dataset, and the experimental result demonstrate the proposed model is better than other in terms of accuracy.},

Tremendous researches of DL techniques have been applied in machine health monitoring, but still very limited works focus on the application of DL on the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction. Precise RUL prediction can significantly improve the reliability and operational safety of the industrial components or systems, avoid fatal breakdown and reduce the maintenance costs. This paper gives a brief introduction of RUL prediction and reviews the start-of-the-art DL approaches in terms of four main representative deep architectures, including Auto-encoder, Deep Belief Network (DBN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). It has been observed that DL techniques attract growing interests on RUL prediction that suggests a promising future of their applications in manufacturing.},

To overcome these issues, artificial protection for Li metal prior to assembling the cell/battery is needed. Here we show a facile approach to               in situ               coating of a protected layer on the Li metal anode by directly placing a PVDF-HFP/AlF               3               modified Celgard separator on its surface. We find that AlF               3               can react with highly reactive Li metal and produce a LiF coating on Li metal               in situ               . This LiF-rich SEI layer can effectively passivate the highly active Li anode surface and suppress the lithium dendrite growth, forming a uniform structure on the Li/electrolyte interface that reduces interfacial impedance. Owing to the enhanced interface stability, the Li{$\Vert$}Li cell presents a stable polarization voltage for approximately 600 h compared with the blank cell (45 h). The Li{$\Vert$}LiFePO               4               cell with the composite separator has a high capacity retention of 78.3\% after 300 cycles at the 3C rate, exhibiting an improvement in the cycling life of high energy-density Li metal batteries.},

  abstract = {在全球信息化产业快速发展的今天,集成电路中元器件的数目以超出摩尔定律的速度快速增长,以满足电子产品小型化及多功能化的特点。电子产品封装密度的不断提高及元器件尺寸的减少,使得封装系统中的重要组成部分\textemdash\textemdash 互连焊点在服役过程承受过高的电流密度及焦耳热作用,加速焊点电迁移现象的产生。因此,电迁移成为焊点重要的可靠性问题。钎料复合的方式是提高焊点综合可靠性的有效方法之一,在钎料基体中加入Cu\_6Sn\_5增强相能够有效提高焊点的力学性能,因此选用Cu\_6Sn\_5作为增强相以提高焊点电迁移可靠性。探究Cu\_6Sn\_5增强相对焊点电迁移行为的抑制机理为本论文的研究重点之一,能够为焊点电迁移可靠性的提高提出有效方法。另外,由于无铅互连焊点中Sn为主要成分,Sn的各向异性对焊点的电迁移行为产生了重要的影响,然而Sn晶体取向的影响作用却往往被忽视。因此,系统的研究Sn晶体取向对复合钎料焊点电迁移行为影响及影响机理为本论文的另一研究重点,为更好地理解Sn晶体取向对焊点电迁移行为的影响奠定了理论基础。主要研究内容和结果如下:1.基于Sn基焊点晶体取向分析,研究焊点c轴轴向对焊点电迁移行为的影响规律。针对Sn基无铅钎料焊点建立Sn晶体取向的确定方法,通过确定Sn晶体c轴与电子流动方向夹角(\texttheta 角)和c轴的轴向,来确定焊点中Sn的晶体取向,并基于Cu\_6Sn\_5增强Sn3.5Ag复合钎料焊点,研究c轴轴向对焊点电迁移行为的影响。通过在电迁移过程中对焊点表面微观组织及内部微观组织进行研究,表明Cu原子在Sn晶体c轴指向的观察面积累形成IMC,在c轴反向指向的观察面消耗,且伴随溶解现象产生,并阐述了Sn晶体c轴轴向在电迁移过程中对Cu原子扩散方向及IMC分布的影响规律。2.基于Cu\_6Sn\_5增强Sn3.5Ag复合钎料焊点,研究不同\texttheta 角对焊点电迁移行为的影响规律。对\texttheta 角为30\textasciitilde o、45\textasciitilde o、60\textasciitilde o、75\textasciitilde o、90\textasciitilde o的两组焊点,分别从其正向观察面和反向观察面,分析电迁移过程中正极界面IMC层的厚度、钎料基体内IMC的生长、负极界面溶解现象随\texttheta 角变化的影响规律,表明随着\texttheta 角的减小,焊点中正极IMC层增厚变快,钎料基体内IMC增长速度增加,负极溶解现象越来越剧烈,电迁移现象越来越严重。建立了Cu原子扩散系数与\texttheta 角之间的关系,并阐述了\texttheta 角在电迁移过程中对焊点正极界面IMC层的厚度、钎料基体内IMC的生长、及负极界面溶解现象的影响规律。3.通过对比无增强相的Sn3.5Ag焊点电迁移现象,研究Cu\_6Sn\_5增强相对焊点电迁移可靠性的作用。对\texttheta 角为30\textasciitilde o、60\textasciitilde o、90\textasciitilde o的Sn3.5Ag焊点电迁移行为进行研究,基于Sn晶体c轴轴向和\texttheta 角对焊点电迁移影响规律,通过对具有相同\texttheta 角的Sn3.5Ag钎料焊点和Cu\_6Sn\_5增强Sn3.5Ag复合钎料焊点的正极界面IMC层、钎料基体内IMC的生长、负极溶解现象及电迁移寿命进行对比分析,表明Cu\_6Sn\_5增强相的引入能够有效抑制焊点正极界面及钎料基体内IMC的生长,推迟负极界面溶解现象及空洞的产生,并延长焊点的电迁移寿命。4.基于焊点微观组织结构分析,研究高电流密度载荷下Cu\_6Sn\_5增强相的加入提高焊点电迁移可靠性的强化机理。基于Cu\_6Sn\_5增强Sn3.5Ag钎料焊点,通过观察不同电迁移阶段IMC/Sn相界面,阐述了钎料基体内IMC长大时相界面的演变过程及对电迁移过程的阻碍作用,IMC相通过阻碍Cu原子扩散,使其在相界面积累并形成IMC,减少钎料基体中扩散的Cu原子数量。通过表征钎料基体内IMC的衍射花样,表明IMC晶体结构为六方晶系Cu\_6Sn\_5超结构,其在电迁移过程中存在两种状态:完整有序超结构和超结构``过渡态'',``过渡态''在形成完整有序超结构时吸收相界外Cu原子,通过吸收作用间接消耗钎料基体中扩散的Cu原子。并阐述了Cu\_6Sn\_5增强相抑制焊点电迁移的作用机理,通过阻碍作用和吸收作用两种方式将钎料基体扩散中的Cu原子以形成IMC的方式束缚在初始IMC上,该过程减少电迁移过程中到达焊点正极界面的Cu原子数量,并增加钎料基体中Cu原子的浓度,提高钎料基体/负极界面浓度梯度,减缓负极界面向钎料基体扩散的速度,从而实现提高焊点电迁移可靠性的作用。},

  abstract = {电迁移是高电流条件下,由于电子流不断与金属原子碰撞并动量交换,进而驱使金属原子沿着电子流方向扩散迁移的现象。电迁移主要发生在微电子封装互连结构内,导致在互连阴极处物质减少而形成空洞,空洞发展为裂纹造成短路破坏,降低整个电子器件的可靠性。随着电子产品不断向着小型化、多功能化、高功率化的趋势发展导致微电子封装互连结构的电流密度持续提高进而达到诱发电迁移的阙值,微电子封装互连结构内电迁移诱发的损伤失效现象已越发突出。电迁移问题已经成为下一代微电子封装互连结构在高电流条件下可靠性的主要问题。本文中针对电迁移诱发的损伤失效进行了力学建模研究,为下一代微电子封装互连结构高电流下的可靠性分析建立理论基础。首先针对微电子封装互连焊点电流集中区域的裂纹化空洞\textemdash\textemdash 薄饼型食指状空洞进行研究,根据质量扩散理论建立了包含速度参数和形状参数的食指状空洞在电迁移作用下拓展的二阶非齐次常微分方程,得到了空洞速度与空洞形状的定量关系并解析求解了电迁移作用下的空洞拓展速度。研究表明空洞速度对空洞宽度的敏感性很高,食指状空洞宽度越小空洞拓展越快。计算得到的理论空洞拓展速度较好的吻合焊点电迁移试验中测得的薄饼型食指状空洞拓展速度。在薄饼型食指状空洞研究的基础上,进一步对一般形式下电迁移诱导的空洞形貌演化问题进行分析。利用柯西积分以及共形映射方法求解了以圆形、椭圆形、心形三种基本形状为代表的空洞存在下平面内的电场分布。基于扩散质量守恒得到空洞形状演化的法向速度。基于三种空洞的形状演化趋势,明确了初始空洞的稳态迁移,裂纹化空洞的拓展以及空洞凹陷的机理。研究表明,在半径比较小时初始圆形空洞稳态迁移,当其半径达到一定程度并受到外界干扰后,空洞会向着裂纹或者凹陷两种情况发展且表面张力并不会驱使空洞形状恢复。进一步在单空洞研究的基础上,进行了电迁移诱导下的多空洞形貌演化分析。根据反平面剪切的类比,求解了包含两个圆形空洞在内的平面内电场分布,根据两种基本双圆形空洞模型,进行了电迁移诱导下的多空洞形貌演化趋势的分析,阐明了多空洞形状失稳,融合和分裂的机理。在多空洞分析基础上,明确了空洞裂纹化以及空洞凹陷化产生的物理原因。利用概率统计的相关理论,进一步建立了电迁移作用下焊点内棉絮型群空洞的体积增长的统计物理模型,推导得到焊点内群空洞体积随时间增长的公式,明确了电迁移作用下群空洞体积增长的机理。在对电迁移诱导的损伤演化的基础上,进一步研究了微电子封装互连结构中电迁移破坏的平均失效时间的预测问题。在半经验的平均失效时间公式\textemdash\textemdash Black公式基础上,本文中分别考虑具体的物理机制,分别是:空洞萌生机制,空洞增长机制和焦耳热效应。基于扩散诱导应力求解了空洞萌生问题,利用晶界扩散方法计算了空洞增长的时间,建立热电耦合模型进行了温度集中现象的仿真,利用扩散系数阿伦尼乌斯公式引入焦耳热效应。明确了电迁移寿命预测公式中的电流密度指数的变化机理,解决了工程领域电流密度指数随机变化的悖论,得到了新的具有具体物理意义的电迁移平均失效时间预测公式。随着多物理场力学模型复杂度的不断提高,数值算法越发必要。在多物理问题以及细微观力学研究的基础上,改进传统的多尺度有限元方法,利用等效夹杂理论建立了有限元中数值解与误差的联系,推导多尺度有限元弱形式方程。基于Zienkiewicz\textemdash Zhu估计和有限区域内多边形夹杂的Eshelby张量,建立新的细观多尺度有限元方法。分别考虑三角形单元以及四边形单元的情况,并与传统有限元方法和原始细观多尺度方法进行对比。结果表明改进的细观多尺度有限元方法与两种传统方法相比,在不改变刚度矩阵规模的基础上具有更高的精度,更快的收敛速度。改进的细观尺度有限元方法具有自适应及自调整的智能特性,且考虑了单元形状的影响,数值解对网格形状的依赖性低。在未来多物理场条件下的微观损伤的数值模拟中具有较大潜力。},

Specifically, we transform the inputs of a spectral mixture base kernel with a deep architecture, using local kernel interpolation, inducing points, and structure exploiting (Kronecker and Toeplitz) algebra for a scalable kernel representation. These closed-form kernels can be used as drop-in replacements for standard kernels, with benefits in expressive power and scalability. We jointly learn the properties of these kernels through the marginal likelihood of a Gaussian process. Inference and learning cost O(n) for n training points, and predictions cost O(1) per test point. On a large and diverse collection of applications, including a dataset with 2 million examples, we show improved performance over scalable Gaussian processes with flexible kernel learning models, and stand-alone deep architectures.},

  abstract = {In this work, we introduce the ConvPDE-UQ framework for constructing light-weight numerical solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) using convolutional neural networks. A theoretical justification for the neural network approximation to partial differential equation solvers on varied domains is established based on the existence and properties of Green's functions. These solvers are able to effectively reduce the computational demands of traditional numerical methods into a single forward-pass of a convolutional network. The network architecture is also designed to predict pointwise Gaussian posterior distributions, with weights trained to minimize the associated negative log-likelihood of the observed solutions. This setup facilitates simultaneous training and uncertainty quantification for the network's solutions, allowing the solver to provide pointwise uncertainties for its predictions. The associated training procedure avoids the computationally expensive Bayesian inference steps used by other state-of-the-art uncertainty models and allows training to be scaled to the large data sets required for learning on varied problem domains. The performance of the framework is demonstrated on three distinct classes of PDEs consisting of two linear elliptic problem setups and a nonlinear Poisson problem. After a single offline training procedure for each class, the proposed networks are capable of accurately predicting the solutions to linear and nonlinear elliptic problems with heterogeneous source terms defined on any specified two-dimensional domain using just a single forward-pass of a convolutional neural network. Additionally, an analysis of the predicted pointwise uncertainties is presented with experimental evidence establishing the validity of the network's uncertainty quantification schema.

  abstract = {Simulating complex physical systems often involves solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with some closures due to the presence of multi-scale physics that cannot be fully resolved. Although the advancement of high performance computing has made resolving small-scale physics possible, such simulations are still very expensive. Therefore, reliable and accurate closure models for the unresolved physics remains an important requirement for many computational physics problems, e.g., turbulence simulation. Recently, several researchers have adopted generative adversarial networks (GANs), a novel paradigm of training machine learning models, to generate solutions of PDEs-governed complex systems without having to numerically solve these PDEs. However, GANs are known to be difficult in training and likely to converge to local minima, where the generated samples do not capture the true statistics of the training data. In this work, we present a statistical constrained generative adversarial network by enforcing constraints of covariance from the training data, which results in an improved machine-learning-based emulator to capture the statistics of the training data generated by solving fully resolved PDEs. We show that such a statistical regularization leads to better performance compared to standard GANs, measured by (1) the constrained model's ability to more faithfully emulate certain physical properties of the system and (2) the significantly reduced (by up to 80\%) training time to reach the solution. We exemplify this approach on the Rayleigh-Benard convection, a turbulent flow system that is an idealized model of the Earth's atmosphere. With the growth of high-fidelity simulation databases of physical systems, this work suggests great potential for being an alternative to the explicit modeling of closures or parameterizations for unresolved physics, which are known to be a major source of uncertainty in simulating multi-scale physical systems, e.g., turbulence or Earth's climate.

The quality requirements of QFNs are increasing and require that no delamination or voids occur inside the package during the reflow process and precondition tests. Therefore, interfacial delamination is still a critical reliability issue for QFNs. Delamination failure weakens the internal structural strength of a QFN and affects the product reliability.

The various diffusion pathways such as diffusion of lithium as a substitution atom and various mechanisms are investigated with ab initio molecular dynamics. The energy barrier has been calculated corresponding to each possible pathway. Theoretically, we have identified that lithium can diffuse through copper thin film by successive nearest neighbor vacancy-atom exchanges, therefore, the nearest neighbor vacancy assisted jumping is deduced to be the most probable by comparing the different mechanisms. It is found that more free diffusion may be observed by increasing the number of copper vacancies in the thin film. It is also confirmed that the diffusion is more obvious as temperature is increased.},

This F-Principle of DNNs is opposite to the behavior of Jacobi method, a conventional iterative numerical scheme, which exhibits faster convergence for higher frequencies for various scientific computing problems. With theories under an idealized setting, we illustrate that this F-Principle results from the smoothness/regularity of the commonly used activation functions. The F-Principle implies an implicit bias that DNNs tend to fit training data by a low-frequency function. This understanding provides an explanation of good generalization of DNNs on most real datasets and bad generalization of DNNs on parity function or a randomized dataset.},

Specifically, we employ latent variable models to construct probabilistic representations for the system states, and put forth an adversarial inference procedure for training them on data, while constraining their predictions to satisfy given physical laws expressed by partial differential equations. Such physics-informed constraints provide a regularization mechanism for effectively training deep generative models as surrogates of physical systems in which the cost of data acquisition is high, and training data-sets are typically small. This provides a flexible framework for characterizing uncertainty in the outputs of physical systems due to randomness in their inputs or noise in their observations that entirely bypasses the need for repeatedly sampling expensive experiments or numerical simulators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a series of examples involving uncertainty propagation in non-linear conservation laws, and the discovery of constitutive laws for flow through porous media directly from noisy data.

This allows an efficient inference of the posterior distributions over plausible models with quantified uncertainty, while the use of sparsity-promoting priors enables the discovery of interpretable and parsimonious representations for the underlying latent dynamics. A series of numerical studies is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, including nonlinear oscillators, predator-prey systems and examples from systems biology.

In this Bayesian framework, the Bayesian neural network (BNN) combined with a PINN for PDEs serves as the prior while the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) or the variational inference (VI) could serve as an estimator of the posterior. B-PINNs make use of both physical laws and scattered noisy measurements to provide predictions and quantify the aleatoric uncertainty arising from the noisy data in the Bayesian framework. Compared with PINNs, in addition to uncertainty quantification, B-PINNs obtain more accurate predictions in scenarios with large noise due to their capability of avoiding overfitting. We conduct a systematic comparison between the two different approaches for the B-PINNs posterior estimation (i.e., HMC or VI), along with dropout used for quantifying uncertainty in deep neural networks. Our experiments show that HMC is more suitable than VI with mean field Gaussian approximation for the B-PINNs posterior estimation, while dropout employed in PINNs can hardly provide accurate predictions with reasonable uncertainty. Finally, we replace the BNN in the prior with a truncated Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion combined with HMC or a deep normalizing flow (DNF) model as posterior estimators. The KL is as accurate as BNN and much faster but this framework cannot be easily extended to high-dimensional problems unlike the BNN based framework. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

However, they require solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) with wide electrochemical stability windows (ESW, typically {$>$}4.2 V) and high-stability against the Li anode. Nevertheless, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), the most widely used solid polymer electrolyte (SPE), can't tolerate a high-voltage over 4 V. Whether the main chain (\textendash C\textendash O\textendash C\textendash ) or the terminal hydroxide group (\textendash OH) is the limiting factor for the narrow ESW remains unknown. Herein, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(ethylene glycol)dimethyl ether (PEGDME) with different terminal groups are selected to answer this question. The results show that the reactive terminal \textendash OH group is the limiting factor towards applicability against high voltage and the Li anode.

  abstract = {We developed a new class of physics-informed generative adversarial networks (PI-GANs) to solve forward, inverse, and mixed stochastic problems in a unified manner based on a limited number of scattered measurements. Unlike standard GANs relying solely on data for training, here we encoded into the architecture of GANs the governing physical laws in the form of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using automatic differentiation. In particular, we applied Wasserstein GANs with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) for its enhanced stability compared to vanilla GANs. We first tested WGAN-GP in approximating Gaussian processes of different correlation lengths based on data realizations collected from simultaneous reads at sparsely placed sensors. We obtained good approximation of the generated stochastic processes to the target ones even if there is a mismatch between the input noise dimensionality and the effective dimensionality of the target stochastic processes. We also studied the overfitting issue for both the discriminator and the generator, and we found that overfitting occurs also in the generator in addition to the discriminator as previously reported. Subsequently, we considered the solution of elliptic SDEs requiring approximations of three stochastic processes, namely the solution, the forcing, and the diffusion coefficient. Here again, we assumed data collected from simultaneous reads at a limited number of sensors for the multiple stochastic processes. Three generators were used for the PI-GANs: two of them were feed forward deep neural networks (DNNs), while the other one was the neural network induced by the SDE. For the case where we have one group of data, we employed one feed forward DNN as the discriminator, while for the case of multiple groups of data we employed multiple discriminators in PI-GANs. We solved forward, inverse, and mixed problems without changing the framework of PI-GANs, obtaining both the means and the standard deviations of the stochastic solution and the diffusion coefficient in good agreement with benchmarks. In this work, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of PI-GANs in solving SDEs for about 120 dimensions. In principle, PI-GANs could tackle very high dimensional problems given more sensor data with low-polynomial growth in computational cost.},

Herein we proposed a failure mechanism of Li metal anode in Li-S cells based on the mechanistic investigation into the complex interactions between LiPSs and Li metal. The LiPSs participate the formation of inorganic layers in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in a LiPS-LiNO3 containing ether-based electrolyte. Li metal anode is well protected by the stable inorganic layer in-situ formed in an electrolyte containing 0.020 M Li2S5 (0.10 M sulfur) and 5.0 wt \% LiNO3. The metal anode with LiF-Li2Sx riched SEI rendered a stable Coulombic efficiency of 95\% after 233 cycles for Li-Cu half cells. A dendrite-free morphology of Li metal anode is observed under the harsh condition. When the LiPS is with a very high concentration of higher than 0.50 M sulfur in the organic electrolyte, the in-situ formed SEI cannot well maintain and the Li metal is gradually etched. Therefore, the polysulfide dissolution and diffusion should be delicately regulated to render a practical Li-S cell when the areal sulfur loading is high.},

  abstract = {Many current deep neural network (DNN) models only focus on straightforward optimization over the given database. However, most numerical fitting procedures depart from physical laws. By introducing the concept of "catalysis" from physical chemistry, we propose that the physical correlations among molecular properties could spontaneously act as a catalyst in the DNNs, which increases the accuracy, and more importantly, guides the DNNs in the right way. These Catalysis-DNNs (Cat-DNNs) could precisely predict both the ground and excited-state properties, especially the molecules' screening with singlet fission character. We show that traditional machine learning metrics are not suitable for evaluating model accuracy in physical-chemical tasks and issue new physical errors. We believe that the agile transfer of fundamental physics or chemistry domain knowledge, like the catalyst, could significantly benefit both the architecture and application of artificial intelligence technology in the future.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Fabricating a robust interfacial layer on the lithium metal anode to isolate it from liquid electrolyte is vital to restrain the rapid degradation of a lithium metal battery. Here, we report that the solution-processed metal chloride perovskite thin film can be coated onto the lithium metal surface as a robust interfacial layer to shield the lithium metal from liquid electrolyte. Via phase analysis and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the perovskite layer can allow fast lithium ion shuttle under a low energy barrier of 0.45\,eV without the collapse of framework. Such perovskite modification can realize stable cycling of LiCoO               2               |Li cells with an areal capacity of 2.8 mAh cm               -2               using thin lithium metal foil (50\,{$\mu$}m) and limited electrolyte (20\,{$\mu$}l mAh               -1               ) for over 100 cycles at 0.5\,C. The metal chloride perovskite protection strategy could open a promising avenue for advanced lithium metal batteries.},

  abstract = {Unexpected main bearing failure on a wind turbine causes unwanted maintenance and increased operation costs (mainly due to crane, parts, labor, and production loss). Unfortunately, historical data indicates that failure can happen far earlier than the component design lives. Root cause analysis investigations have pointed to problems inherent from manufacturing as the major contributor, as well as issues related to event loads (e.g., startups, shutdowns, and emergency stops), extreme environmental conditions, and maintenance practices, among others. Altogether, the multiple failure modes and contributors make modeling the remaining useful life of main bearings a very daunting task. In this paper, we present a novel physics-informed neural network modeling approach for main bearing fatigue. The proposed approach is fully hybrid and designed to merge physics-informed and data-driven layers within deep neural networks. The result is a cumulative damage model where the physics-informed layers are used model the relatively well-understood physics (L10 fatigue life) and the data-driven layers account for the hard to model components (i.e., grease degradation).},

The challenge becomes especially serious when the cathode voltage reaches 5 V and above. Here, we developed an additive-containing electrolyte that can concurrently stabilize the Li metal anode and the 5 V class LiNi               0.5               Mn               1.5               O               4               (LNMO) cathode by introducing tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPFPB) to the traditional ethylene carbonate/ethyl methyl carbonate (EC/EMC) electrolyte. The boron element and pentafluorobenzene in TPFPB induce preferential formation of a steady and smooth interfacial layer on both the Li and LNMO electrodes, subsequently preventing the decomposition of the electrolyte, impeding the pulverization of the cathode electrode, and retarding the growth of Li dendrites. Accordingly, we accomplish high average coulombic efficiency of {$>$}99.2\% and superior capacity retention of 90\% after 500 cycles at 0.5C with charge cut-off voltage of 4.95 V, which is one of the highest results for cycling among 5 V-class Li metal batteries with 90\% capacity retention. This study provides essential technological implications for the electrolyte design for high-voltage Li\textendash metal batteries.},

  abstract = {Although traditional graphite anodes ensure the cycling stability and safety of lithium-ion batteries, the inherent drawbacks, particularly low theoretical specific capacity (372 mAh{$\cdot$}g{$^-$}1) and Li-free character, of such anodes limit their applications in high energy density battery systems, especially in lithium-sulfur and lithium-air batteries. Lithium metal has been considered as one of the best next-generation anode materials due to its extremely high theoretical specific capacity (3860 mAh{$\cdot$}g{$^-$}1) and low redox potential (-3.04 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode). The first generation of commercial rechargeable lithium metal batteries were developed by Moli Energy in the late 1980s and were not widely used due to several problems, including low coulombic efficiency, poor cycle stability, and safety hazards. These problems associated with the Li metal anode are mainly caused by lithium dendrite growth, electrode volume changes, and interface instability. During the charge and discharge processes, Li deposition is not uniform across the electrode surface. Due to the low surface energy and high migration energy of Li metal, dendrites are preferentially formed during Li deposition. These dendrites proceed to grow with successive battery cycling, penetrate the separator, and eventually reach the cathode, thereby causing short circuits and thermal runaway. Additionally, the growth of the lithium dendrite is inherently correlated with the reaction interface structure, and dendrite growth results in inhomogeneity of the SEI (solid electrolyte interface) which is inevitably formed on the Li metal surfaces. Moreover, the volume change of lithium metal anodes is of importance, particularly during battery cycling and Li stripping/deposition processes which make the SEI layers considerably unstable. SEI layers usually cannot withstand the mechanical deformation caused by volume changes; such layers continuously break and repair during cycling and consume large amounts of the electrolyte. Additionally, some Li dendrites could break and become wrapped by SEI layers to form electrically isolated ``dead'' Li, which results in the loss of active Li in the Li metal anode. All these factors are responsible for the failure of Li metal anodes. Herein, recent investigations on the failure mechanisms of lithium metal anodes are reviewed and summarized, including the formation of SEI layers on the surface of Li metal anodes, the behavior and mechanism of lithium dendrite growth, and the mechanism of ``dead'' lithium formation. Additionally, some advanced characterization techniques for investigating lithium metal anodes are introduced, including in situ tools, cryoelectron microscopy, neutron depth analysis technology, and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance technology. These techniques enable researchers to gain in-depth insights into the failure mechanisms of Li metal anodes.},

  abstract = {As a new way of training generative models, Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) that uses a discriminative model to guide the training of the generative model has enjoyed considerable success in generating real-valued data. However, it has limitations when the goal is for generating sequences of discrete tokens. A major reason lies in that the discrete outputs from the generative model make it difficult to pass the gradient update from the discriminative model to the generative model. Also, the discriminative model can only assess a complete sequence, while for a partially generated sequence, it is non-trivial to balance its current score and the future one once the entire sequence has been generated. In this paper, we propose a sequence generation framework, called SeqGAN, to solve the problems. Modeling the data generator as a stochastic policy in reinforcement learning (RL), SeqGAN bypasses the generator differentiation problem by directly performing gradient policy update. The RL reward signal comes from the GAN discriminator judged on a complete sequence, and is passed back to the intermediate state-action steps using Monte Carlo search. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world tasks demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines.},

RUL prediction is a promising way to reduce high maintenance costs for high-speed railways. However, there is no sufficient actual life-cycle data due to the lack of sensors, and no mature physics-offailure model of the equipment in high-speed railways, which make it difficult to predict RUL. To solving this problem, firstly the failure modes, mechanisms, and effects of the D-cables are first analyzed, and accelerated life tests are run under different thermal stresses in Ansys to obtain the life-cycle data. Based on the lifecycle data, particle filtering (PF) method predicts the RUL based on Paris-Law model, meanwhile feedforward neural network (FNN) predicts the RUL under the same thermal stress with PF method, finally a hybrid RUL prediction method that combines model-based and data-driven methods is developed. The results are verified using simulation.},

  abstract = {Modern drilling equipment faces increasingly severe environments, with bottom hole temperatures excessing 200 degrees C and high vibration stresses. Meanwhile, customers continuously demand high reliability to prevent bottom hole failures, which result in one half or two days of nonproductive time (NPT) on drilling rigs costing \$100K-\$1M per day [1]. However, the current periodic maintenance strategy is insufficient and costly to meet the new challenges. From a cost-effective perspective, developing a conditional-based maintenance (CBM) prognostic model to evaluate the health condition of bottom hole assembly (BHA) tools becomes important and necessary for the oil and gas industry. This paper presents a CBM prognostic model for assessing the life consumption (LC) of BHA tools. Based on the analysis of physics of failure (PoF) [2], there are four major impacts on electronics reliability, i.e., lateral vibration (LV), stick slip (STI), temperature (TEMP), and axial vibration (AX) [1][2]. The CBM prognostic model described in this paper is acumulative damage model with weibull distribution, which is a linear regression model synthesizing the four impacts. To estimate the parameters of the model, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is utilized. The confidence interval and the Fisher information matrixtheories are applied to assess the LC intervals of the tools. The developed model will allow service providers to make more efficient decisions to reduce operation cost and increase downholoe tool availability and reliability.},

  abstract = {Modern drilling equipment faces increasingly severe environments, with bottom hole temperatures excessing 200 degrees C and high vibration stresses. Meanwhile, customers continuously demand high reliability to prevent bottom hole failures, which result in one half or two days of nonproductive time (NPT) on drilling rigs costing \$100K-\$1M per day [1]. However, the current periodic maintenance strategy is insufficient and costly to meet the new challenges. From a cost-effective perspective, developing a conditional-based maintenance (CBM) prognostic model to evaluate the health condition of bottom hole assembly (BHA) tools becomes important and necessary for the oil and gas industry. This paper presents a CBM prognostic model for assessing the life consumption (LC) of BHA tools. Based on the analysis of physics of failure (PoF) [2], there are four major impacts on electronics reliability, i.e., lateral vibration (LV), stick slip (STI), temperature (TEMP), and axial vibration (AX) [1][2]. The CBM prognostic model described in this paper is acumulative damage model with weibull distribution, which is a linear regression model synthesizing the four impacts. To estimate the parameters of the model, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is utilized. The confidence interval and the Fisher information matrixtheories are applied to assess the LC intervals of the tools. The developed model will allow service providers to make more efficient decisions to reduce operation cost and increase downholoe tool availability and reliability.},

  abstract = {In the advanced semiconductor industry, modern electronic devices are expected to realize complex functions with minimized size, which requires an increase in the density of on-chip interconnects. To meet this demand, the dimension of interconnects is reduced and it requires the narrowing of metal interconnects to carry the increasing current density. With such a developing trend, electromigration is one of the significant reliability challenges for electronic devices. Although lots of works focus on the formulation and simulation for electromigration, they are not complete and consistent with experimental results. Recently, A fully-coupled and self-consistent electromigration theory was developed by Cui et al, but new and extensive experimental data and analysis are needed to further validate their theoretical results.\&lt;br/\&gt;This research work focuses on the experimental study on electromigration (EM), and the aim is to investigate the different effects on EM. The Blech structure was proposed as our experimental structure. The fabrication of Blech structure is conducted at the EKL cleanroom, and main structures with various dimensions are fabricated by employing sputtering technique for deposition and lithography for defining patterns. The measurement is carried out by accelerated tests with high current stress and at elevated temperature. Experimental results are characterized and analyzed by different tools, such as Keyence 3D laser profilometer and scanning electron microscope\&lt;br/\&gt;With the current density of 1\texttimes 1010퐴/푚2 and temperature of 250 \textcelsius, the result shows that the critical length under certain conditions is 10 {$\mu$}m, and longer stripes have larger drift lengths and a shorter time to form voids in electromigration. Furthermore, it is found that with elevated temperature, the drift length increases and the electromigration lifetime decreases. In addition, the covered SiN passivation layer only for the annealed Al stripes suppresses electromigration and this is because the annealing process improves the coalescence of grain in Al film, reducing the defects at the grain boundary and finally forming a denser microstructure. The influence of the atmosphere on electromigration indicates that the additional oxide on Al interconnects increases that actual current stress and results in a short electromigration lifetime. In general, present experimental results were consistent with existing results in the literature, but several problems are still unsolved, which will be part of our future work.},

Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and lithium nitrate (LiNO3) were concurrently introduced into electrolyte, altering the solvation sheath of Li ions and then forming uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with abundant LiF and LiNxOy on a working Li metal anode that contributes to dendrite-free Li deposition. Ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency (99.96\%) and long lifespans (1000 cycles) were achieved when FEC/LiNO3 electrolyte was applied in working batteries. The solvation chemistry of electrolyte was further explored by molecular dynamics simulations and first-principles calculations. This work provides a fruitful insight on understanding the critical role of the solvation of Li ions in forming SEI and delivers an effective route to optimize electrolytes for safe Li metal batteries.},

  abstract = {One of the open problems in scientific computing is the long-time integration of non-linear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), especially with arbitrary initial data. We address this problem by taking advantage of recent advances in scientific machine learning and the spectral dynamically orthogonal (DO) and borthogonal (BO) methods for representing stochastic processes. The recently introduced DO/BO methods reduce the SPDE to solving a system of deterministic PDEs and a system of stochastic ordinary differential equations. Specifically, we propose two new physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving time-dependent SPDEs, namely the neural network (NN)-DO/BO methods. The proposed methods incorporate the DO/BO constraints into the loss function (along with the modal decomposition of the SPDE) with an implicit form instead of generating explicit expressions for the temporal derivatives of the DO/BO modes. Hence, the NN-DO/BO methods can overcome some of the drawbacks of the original DO/BO methods. For example, we do not need the assumption that the covariance matrix of the random coefficients is invertible as in the original DO method, and we can remove the assumption of no eigenvalue crossing as in the original BO method. Moreover, the NN-DO/BO methods can be used to solve time-dependent stochastic inverse problems with the same formulation and same computational complexity as for forward problems. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed methods via several numerical examples, namely: (1) A linear stochastic advection equation with deterministic initial condition: we obtain good results with the proposed methods, while the original DO/BO methods cannot be applied directly in this case. (2) Long-time integration of the stochastic Burgers' equation: we show the good performance of NN-DO/BO methods, especially the effectiveness of the NN-BO approach for such problems with many eigenvalue crossings during the whole time evolution, while the original BO method fails. (3) Nonlinear reaction diffusion equation: we consider both the forward problem and the inverse problems, including very noisy initial point values, to investigate the flexibility of the NN-DO/BO methods in handling inverse and mixed type problems. Taken together, these simulation results demonstrate that the NN-DO/BO methods can be employed to effectively quantify uncertainty propagation in a wide range of physical problems, but future work should address the efficiency issue of PINNs for forward problems.},

In view of the increase of chip integration and the reduction of micro-bump size in 3D ICs, the high current density and excessive Joule heat will result in serious reliability issues of electromigration (EM) and thermomigration (TM) respectively, which evidently shorten the lifetime of solder joints. This article reviewed the influence of EM, TM and their coupling effect on microstructure evolution and properties of different joints soldered with pure Sn, SnAgCu, SnBi and SnZn solder. What's more, the increase of EM and TM resistances of micro-joints by microalloying, particle reinforcement and substrate improvement was explored. Finally, the shortcomings of current studies and the future research directions were summarized to further improve the EM and TM reliability of micro-joints, which promotes the application of lead-free solders in 3D ICs package.},

  abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as an alternative way of numerically solving partial differential equations (PDEs) without the need of building elaborate grids, instead, using a straightforward implementation. In particular, in addition to the deep neural network (DNN) for the solution, an auxiliary DNN is considered that represents the residual of the PDE. The residual is then combined with the mismatch in the given data of the solution in order to formulate the loss function. This framework is effective but is lacking uncertainty quantification of the solution due to the inherent randomness in the data or due to the approximation limitations of the DNN architecture. Here, we propose a new method with the objective of endowing the DNN with uncertainty quantification for both sources of uncertainty, i.e., the parametric uncertaintyand the approximation uncertainty. We first account for the parametric uncertainty when the parameter in the differential equation is represented as a stochastic process. Multiple DNNs are designed to learn the modal functions of the arbitrary polynomial chaos(aPC) expansion of its solution by using stochastic data from sparse sensors. We can then make predictions from new sensor measurements very efficiently with the trained DNNs. Moreover, we employ dropoutto quantify the uncertainty of DNNs in approximating the modal functions. We then design an active learningstrategy based on the dropout uncertainty to place new sensors in the domain in order to improve the predictions of DNNs. Several numerical tests are conducted for both the forward and the inverse problems to demonstrate the effectiveness of PINNs combined with uncertainty quantification. This NN-aPC new paradigm of physics-informed deep learning with uncertainty quantification can be readily applied to other types of stochastic PDEs in multi-dimensions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Unfortunately, lithium metal anodes (LMAs) usually suffer from immoderate dendrite growth during the cycling process, which can cause serious safety concerns. Herein, we develop an alloy/polymer double-layered protective coating as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to mitigate the above problem. The inorganic alloy (LiF-rich Li\textendash Sb) layer is lithiophilic with high Li-ion conductivity, enabling dendrite-free plating/stripping of lithium at a high capacity. The organic polymer (commercial rubber) layer is highly flexible, keeping the artificial SEI stable during cycling. The use of double-layered coating results in significantly improved cycling stability for LMAs (500 h for a symmetric cell with a capacity of 1 mA h cm               -2               ) in both ether- and carbonate-based electrolytes, which is much better than for cells employing pristine lithium or single-alloy-protected lithium. It should be noted that the Li\textendash Sb alloy layer was created from a low-cost precursor (SbF               3               ). We believe that the design of double layer protective coating using low-cost raw materials provides a new pathway to achieve dendrite-free LMAs with an enhanced cycling life.},

A major challenge in data-driven prognostics is the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of samples of failure progression. However, for traditional machine learning methods and deep neural networks, enough training data is a prerequisite to train good prediction models. In this work, we proposed a transfer learning algorithm based on Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) recurrent neural networks for RUL estimation, in which the models can be first trained on different but related datasets and then fine-tuned by the target dataset. Extensive experimental results show that transfer learning can in general improve the prediction models on the dataset with a small number of samples. There is one exception that when transferring from multi-type operating conditions to single operating conditions, transfer learning led to a worse result.},

  abstract = {传统的船舶防污涂料采用释放毒料来防止生物附着的方式会破坏海洋生态环境。有机锡等有毒防污涂料已被禁止或限制使用,开发新型环保型防污涂料成为其发展的必然。海洋污损生物的附着都是首先由蛋白质等在材料表面吸附形成条件膜为基础不断发展的,因此设计和控制涂层的组织结构从源头上抑制条件膜的形成对于延缓海生物的附着污损具有重要作用。聚氨酯因为软硬段之间的热力学不相容性而具有微相分离结构,近年来生物医用材料领域的研究表明,具有微相分离结构的聚氨酯能够抑制蛋白质的吸附。因此,本文通过控制聚氨酯的软硬段的结构与含量设计制备出不同微相分离程度的聚氨酯材料,并以所合成的聚氨酯预聚体为成膜物制备了碳纳米管共混聚氨酯涂层、微纳米粉体原位合成聚氨酯涂层,研究聚氨酯的化学结构与微相分离程度对聚氨酯材料及其涂层的力学性能、表面特性以及防污性能的影响规律,并针对其海洋应用环境重点研究了聚氨酯材料及涂层的海水环境响应特性及其海洋防污性能。主要结果如下：首先通过两步法溶液聚合工艺合成了以聚醚多元醇(PPG)为软段、2,4-甲苯二异氰酸酯(TDI)和1,4-丁二醇(BDO)为硬段的PPG-TDI-BDO型一系列不同硬段含量的聚氨酯材料。研究表明,随着PPG-TDI-BDO型聚氨酯硬段含量的增加,聚氨酯的抗拉强度和弹性模量上升、断裂伸长率降低,试样从柔软的弹性体向硬塑料转变。这是因为硬段含量增加后,聚氨酯中的氢键作用增加,交联度增加,限制了聚氨酯中链段的运动。同时由于极性增加,聚氨酯的表面能随硬段含量增加而增加。聚氨酯的微相分离程度与试样的表面粗糙度正相关,随着硬段含量的增加,微相分离程度和粗糙度增大,硬段含量40 wt\%时,均达到最大；硬段含量继续增加,微相分离程度和粗糙度均减小。同时,硬段含量40 wt\%的聚氨酯试样H40其防污性能也最佳。此外,研究中发现当硬段含量为20-40 wt\%时,聚氨酯材料在室温环境下具有本体自愈合特性,即拉伸试样在拉断后将其断口对合,试样会自愈合重新连接。自愈合原位红外光谱分析表明,PPG-TDI-BDO聚氨酯材料的自愈合能力取决于聚氨酯中的氢键含量和链段的可动性。控制硬段含量为40 wt\%,分别设计合成了不同结构异氰酸酯(TDI、MDI和IPDI)和不同结构软段(聚乙二醇(PEG)、聚二甲基硅氧烷(PDMS)、以及含氟丙烯酸酯二元和四元共聚物(BFPA和QFPA))的聚氨酯材料,研究了各种聚氨酯材料及其碳纳米管共混涂层的性能与海水环境响应特性。结果表明,异氰酸酯中的极性基团增加了链段之间的相互作用,同时硬段与软段的相容性差时更容易产生微相分离结构。海水浸泡使聚氨酯的微相分离程度降低,浸泡时间越长,聚氨酯的微相分离程度越低。由于IPDI型聚氨酯中链段之间的相互作用力低导致其更容易发生分解,同时其对底材的附着力明显低于TDI和MDI型聚氨酯。将有机氟和有机硅链段引入到聚氨酯中可明显降低聚氨酯试样的表面能和断裂韧性,增加其微相分离程度。由于有机硅和有机氟链段的低表面特性使得它们在成膜过程中在试样表面富集,明显改善聚氨酯涂层的耐海水性能和稳定性。相反,由于PEG的亲水性强,使海水更容易进入到聚氨酯内部与极性链段反应,降低试样的耐水性。通过原位观测二碘甲烷在聚氨酯材料和涂层与海水界面的接触角变化研究了海水浸泡过程中聚氨酯链段的迁移和分子重构现象,结果发现,随着聚氨酯试样由暴露在空气中转变为浸泡在海水中,浸泡24 h后二碘甲烷在海水与聚氨酯界面的接触角不断增大趋于稳定,聚氨酯涂膜的亲水性不断增大,说明在浸泡初期极性的硬段逐渐向海水界面迁移,以降低体系总的能量。在聚氨酯引入含氟聚合物和有机硅,以及在试样中添加微纳米粉体均可以延缓这一过程的进行。7个月浅海静态挂板试验表明各种碳纳米管共混聚氨酯涂层均表现出良好的防污性能。为了消除传统的共混方式制备涂层存在的纳米粉体分散性差、分布不均匀、易团聚的问题,进一步提高微纳米粉体复合聚氨酯防污涂层的性能,采用粉体原位聚合工艺制备了碳纳米管、电气石和纳米二氧化钛原位分散聚氨酯,并制备了相应的聚氨酯防污涂层,研究了其力学性能、表面特性、海洋防污性能和海水环境响应特性。结果表明,纳米粉体原位聚合分散在聚氨酯中,可以增大聚氨酯的交联程度,提高涂层在海水中的稳定性,减缓极性链段向界面迁移的速度。由于粉体自身具有一定的杀菌性能,使聚氨酯的耐底栖硅藻附着性能比纯聚氨酯试样有所提升。经过7个月浅海静态挂板试验,各种微纳米粉体原位聚合聚氨酯涂层表面无明显的生物附着,均具有优良的防污性能。},

  abstract = {传统的船舶防污涂料采用释放毒料来防止生物附着的方式会破坏海洋生态环境。有机锡等有毒防污涂料已被禁止或限制使用,开发新型环保型防污涂料成为其发展的必然。海洋污损生物的附着都是首先由蛋白质等在材料表面吸附形成条件膜为基础不断发展的,因此设计和控制涂层的组织结构从源头上抑制条件膜的形成对于延缓海生物的附着污损具有重要作用。聚氨酯因为软硬段之间的热力学不相容性而具有微相分离结构,近年来生物医用材料领域的研究表明,具有微相分离结构的聚氨酯能够抑制蛋白质的吸附。因此,本文通过控制聚氨酯的软硬段的结构与含量设计制备出不同微相分离程度的聚氨酯材料,并以所合成的聚氨酯预聚体为成膜物制备了碳纳米管共混聚氨酯涂层、微纳米粉体原位合成聚氨酯涂层,研究聚氨酯的化学结构与微相分离程度对聚氨酯材料及其涂层的力学性能、表面特性以及防污性能的影响规律,并针对其海洋应用环境重点研究了聚氨酯材料及涂层的海水环境响应特性及其海洋防污性能。主要结果如下：首先通过两步法溶液聚合工艺合成了以聚醚多元醇(PPG)为软段、2,4-甲苯二异氰酸酯(TDI)和1,4-丁二醇(BDO)为硬段的PPG-TDI-BDO型一系列不同硬段含量的聚氨酯材料。研究表明,随着PPG-TDI-BDO型聚氨酯硬段含量的增加,聚氨酯的抗拉强度和弹性模量上升、断裂伸长率降低,试样从柔软的弹性体向硬塑料转变。这是因为硬段含量增加后,聚氨酯中的氢键作用增加,交联度增加,限制了聚氨酯中链段的运动。同时由于极性增加,聚氨酯的表面能随硬段含量增加而增加。聚氨酯的微相分离程度与试样的表面粗糙度正相关,随着硬段含量的增加,微相分离程度和粗糙度增大,硬段含量40 wt\%时,均达到最大；硬段含量继续增加,微相分离程度和粗糙度均减小。同时,硬段含量40 wt\%的聚氨酯试样H40其防污性能也最佳。此外,研究中发现当硬段含量为20-40 wt\%时,聚氨酯材料在室温环境下具有本体自愈合特性,即拉伸试样在拉断后将其断口对合,试样会自愈合重新连接。自愈合原位红外光谱分析表明,PPG-TDI-BDO聚氨酯材料的自愈合能力取决于聚氨酯中的氢键含量和链段的可动性。控制硬段含量为40 wt\%,分别设计合成了不同结构异氰酸酯(TDI、MDI和IPDI)和不同结构软段(聚乙二醇(PEG)、聚二甲基硅氧烷(PDMS)、以及含氟丙烯酸酯二元和四元共聚物(BFPA和QFPA))的聚氨酯材料,研究了各种聚氨酯材料及其碳纳米管共混涂层的性能与海水环境响应特性。结果表明,异氰酸酯中的极性基团增加了链段之间的相互作用,同时硬段与软段的相容性差时更容易产生微相分离结构。海水浸泡使聚氨酯的微相分离程度降低,浸泡时间越长,聚氨酯的微相分离程度越低。由于IPDI型聚氨酯中链段之间的相互作用力低导致其更容易发生分解,同时其对底材的附着力明显低于TDI和MDI型聚氨酯。将有机氟和有机硅链段引入到聚氨酯中可明显降低聚氨酯试样的表面能和断裂韧性,增加其微相分离程度。由于有机硅和有机氟链段的低表面特性使得它们在成膜过程中在试样表面富集,明显改善聚氨酯涂层的耐海水性能和稳定性。相反,由于PEG的亲水性强,使海水更容易进入到聚氨酯内部与极性链段反应,降低试样的耐水性。通过原位观测二碘甲烷在聚氨酯材料和涂层与海水界面的接触角变化研究了海水浸泡过程中聚氨酯链段的迁移和分子重构现象,结果发现,随着聚氨酯试样由暴露在空气中转变为浸泡在海水中,浸泡24 h后二碘甲烷在海水与聚氨酯界面的接触角不断增大趋于稳定,聚氨酯涂膜的亲水性不断增大,说明在浸泡初期极性的硬段逐渐向海水界面迁移,以降低体系总的能量。在聚氨酯引入含氟聚合物和有机硅,以及在试样中添加微纳米粉体均可以延缓这一过程的进行。7个月浅海静态挂板试验表明各种碳纳米管共混聚氨酯涂层均表现出良好的防污性能。为了消除传统的共混方式制备涂层存在的纳米粉体分散性差、分布不均匀、易团聚的问题,进一步提高微纳米粉体复合聚氨酯防污涂层的性能,采用粉体原位聚合工艺制备了碳纳米管、电气石和纳米二氧化钛原位分散聚氨酯,并制备了相应的聚氨酯防污涂层,研究了其力学性能、表面特性、海洋防污性能和海水环境响应特性。结果表明,纳米粉体原位聚合分散在聚氨酯中,可以增大聚氨酯的交联程度,提高涂层在海水中的稳定性,减缓极性链段向界面迁移的速度。由于粉体自身具有一定的杀菌性能,使聚氨酯的耐底栖硅藻附着性能比纯聚氨酯试样有所提升。经过7个月浅海静态挂板试验,各种微纳米粉体原位聚合聚氨酯涂层表面无明显的生物附着,均具有优良的防污性能。},

  abstract = {船舶及船上附属设备通常都加有涂层保护,但在海上环境服役时,由于海水和海洋性大气的严重腐蚀性以及炎热气候、老化、流体冲刷、生物污损等综合作用,涂层会很快失效。船舶通常在海上服役几个月到半年左右即需要进坞检修,但目前主要靠外观观察来评价涂层的失效程度,缺少能够在现场快速检测评价涂层损伤程度及对涂层性能和使用寿命作出评估的有效方法。由于腐蚀性介质能够通过涂层渗透到金属表面,很多情况下涂层外表面并无明显变化,而涂层内部已经开始变质甚至涂层下方的金属已经发生了腐蚀甚至穿孔,大大降低船舶的在航率,影响设备性能的正常发挥,显著地缩短船舶的使用寿命。很多单位急需开发一种能够快速在现场检测涂层体系完好性和变质程度的新型技术,以有效的指导涂层维护、保养和更新问题,降低维护成本和减少在坞维修时间,使船舶更有效地发挥效率。但由于国内对常用涂层体系在典型海域的失效机制缺少研究,对涂层失效的影响因素了解不足,加之现有的各种涂层检测技术均不具备现场快速检测的功能,此问题始终未能解决。本文采用静态海水浸泡和动态海水模拟两种方法进行了丙烯酸、无锡自抛光和水性三大类九种防污涂层的静态海水浸泡、动态模拟实验,检测了防污涂层的表面形貌、厚度、铜离子释放率等性能随时间的变化,以及模拟航速对它们的影响;利用电化学阻抗谱方法检测涂层EIS的动力学曲线。分析了船底防护涂层EIS的变化规律及影响因素,研究了各项性能随时间的变化规律。研究结果表明:RCC\textemdash II型旋转挂片腐蚀试验仪和DFYF\textemdash 905动态海水腐蚀模拟试验仪运行平稳,利用该这两套装置进行的静态、动态模拟实验较好的模拟了船舶航行时海水与船舶水下防污涂层表面的实际服役工况;丙烯酸、自抛光和水性能防污三种涂层厚度随时间逐渐下降,多数涂层表面形貌没有明显变化。三种防污涂层的防污剂释放率在初始阶段有较大的下降,随后逐渐稳定。模拟航速的增加会加快三种防污涂层表面趋于光滑,增加涂层厚度下降速度,提高涂层防污剂的释放率。不同体系涂层对交流阻抗具有明显的影响,总的趋势是随着浸泡时间增加,两种涂层的电阻Rc都在逐渐减小,Cc都在逐渐增大。这是由于随着浸泡时间增加,涂层孔隙率逐渐增大,更多的电解液通过涂层微孔逐渐渗入涂层中形成微观电通路所致。},

  abstract = {Centrifugal pumps with bearings are widely used in nuclear power plants. A challenge in datadriven prognostic technologies for centrifugal pump bearings is to evaluate their degradation features, which can be combined into degradation trajectory; however, the massive data gathered continuously from condition monitoring systems has created challenges to extracting degradation features effectively. The traditional degradation feature extraction methods are highly reliant on prior knowledge and diagnostic expertise, have limited capacities for learning the complex relationships between the degradation features and the massive amounts of measurement data, and their feature design processes are not automated and require intensive human labor. Deep neural networks offer remarkable abilities to extract features from massive data, and they can be used to automatically extract highly abstracted features that correlate well with bearing degradation. Therefore, to extract centrifugal pump bearing degradation features from massive amounts of vibration data, this paper proposes a deep feature optimization fusion method. First, data from the vibration-frequencydomain are mapped to a nonlinear spatial domain using an enhanced autoencoder. Second, the neural nodes in the last hidden layer of the enhanced autoencoder are divided into several child modules. The minimum quantization errors of each child module are used as the candidate degradation features. Finally, the optimal degradation trajectory is obtained via a weighted fusion of the candidate degradation features. The optimal weighting coefficients are calculated using the grey wolf optimizer algorithm. In this paper, experiments were performed using the IEEE PHM2012 bearing prognostic data set and a centrifugal pump bearing conditionmonitoring data set. The results demonstrate that the degradation trajectory obtained using the proposed method offers stronger predictive capabilities than do those obtained using other methods, thereby improving the accuracy of predictions of the bearings' remaining useful life.},

  abstract = {随着微电子封装制造向微型化、高性能和无铅化趋势快速发展,焊点尺寸随之持续减小,通过焊点的平均电流密度将明显增加,电迁移已成为引起元器件失效的一个重要可靠性问题。同时微型化使焊点可能仅包含一个或数个Sn晶粒,而{$\beta$}-Sn具有明显的扩散各向异性,因此亟待研究Sn晶粒取向对微凸点电迁移行为的影响机制。本论文以线性Cu/Sn3.0Ag0.5Cu (SAC305)/Cu、Cu/Sn/Ni和倒装Ni/SAC305/Cu焊点为研究对象,原位观察研究了Sn晶粒取向对微凸点电迁移失效模式、阴极UBM溶解行为和金属间化合物(Intermetallic Compound, IMC)析出等规律的影响,提出了Sn晶粒取向和阴极溶解量的关系模型,揭示了Sn晶粒扩散各向异性是焊点出现不同电迁移行为的本质原因。具体结论如下：(1)线性Cu/SAC305(两个Sn晶粒)/Cu焊点电迁移研究发现：电迁移失效模式主要取决于阴极侧Sn晶粒取向。当电子从\texttheta (Sn晶粒c轴和电子流动方向之间的夹角)小的Sn晶粒流向\texttheta 大的Sn晶粒时,失效模式表现为Cu基板大量溶解；溶解的Cu原子向阳极扩散的过程中被阻碍在晶界处,最终以Cu6Sn5 IMC在小\texttheta 的Sn晶粒中大量析出；然而当电子反向流动时,失效模式表现为界面空洞裂纹扩展,同时钎料内部并没有IMC的聚集析出。(2)线性Cu/Sn(单晶)/Ni焊点电迁移研究发现：Ni沿着Sn晶粒扩散表现出更为明显的各向异性。当阴极Ni原子沿[001]Sn晶粒扩散时(\texttheta 约为0。),失效模式表现为Ni基板显著溶解；当阴极Ni原子沿[110]Sn晶粒扩散时(\texttheta 约为90。),Ni基板溶解受到明显抑制,阳极IMC生长缓慢,表现出高的抗电迁移性能。(3)倒装Ni/SAC305/Cu焊点电迁移研究发现：当Cu基板作为阴极时,主要存在阴极Cu基板溶解和空洞裂纹扩展两种失效模式,这主要取决于阴极侧Sn晶粒的\texttheta,失效模式分析类似于线性微焊点。此外,模型计算表明Cu基板的溶解量与\texttheta 角呈抛物线规律减少。而当Ni基板作为阴极时,由于界面稳定连续(Cu,Ni)6Sn5层的保护作用和Ni在Sn中的溶解度低的原因,Ni基板未出现明显的溶解现象,失效模式为阴极界面空洞裂纹扩展。Cu6Sn5类型IMC有选择性地在小\texttheta 的Sn晶粒内析出或沿着Sn晶粒的c轴方向析出。此外,原位观察焊点微观形貌发现电迁移过程中钎料将出现应力松弛现象-阳极Sn凸起、阴极钎料下凹和钎料内IMC附近Sn挤出。本论文基于原子扩散通量定量分析和揭示了Cu、Ni和Sn等原子沿Sn晶粒不同方向高的扩散各向异性是焊点出现不同电迁移行为的决定性因素。},

  abstract = {A common issue plaguing battery anodes is the large consumption of lithium in the initial cycle as a result of the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase followed by gradual loss in subsequent cycles. It presents a need for prelithiation to compensate for the loss. However, anode prelithiation faces the challenge of high chemical reactivity because of the low anode potential. Previous efforts have produced prelithiated Si nanoparticles with dry air stability, which cannot be stabilized under ambient air. Here, we developed a one-pot metallurgical process to synthesize Li               x               Si/Li               2               O composites by using low-cost SiO or SiO               2               as the starting material.

The composites are readily mixed with various anode materials to achieve high first cycle Coulombic efficiency (CE) of {$>$}100\% or serve as an excellent anode material by itself with stable cyclability and consistently high CEs (99.81\% at the seventh cycle and {$\sim$}99.87\% for subsequent cycles). Therefore, Li               x               Si/Li               2               O composites achieved balanced reactivity and stability, promising a significant boost to lithium ion batteries.},

They lead to low coulombic efficiency, short cycling lifespan and serious safety issues of Li metal batteries. Here we developed a facile strategy to prepare a nitrogen-doped-carbon/ZnO (NDC/ZnO) modified Cu foam (MCuF) current collector for Li metal anodes. The MCuF shows stable Li plating/stripping behavior with the Li dendrite-mitigation feature. The resultant half cells achieve a super long lifespan of over 600 cycles at 1 mA cm               -2               and over 200 cycles at a high current density 10 mA cm               -2               . Moreover, the full cell paired with LiFePO               4               also exhibits a long lifespan of over 150 cycles at a high rate of 5C. Such high performance can be attributed to the characteristics of MCuF, including its 3D porous structure with high conductivity, enlarged surface area and uniform lithophilic NDC/ZnO sites. We believed that our work can provide a facile strategy for fabricating high-performance 3D current collectors for Li metal storage and stable Li metal batteries.},

  abstract = {In anode free batteries (AFBs), the current collector acts as anode simultaneously and has large volume expansion which is generally considered as a negative effect decreasing the structural stability of a battery. Moreover, despite many studies on the fast lithium diffusion in the current collector materials of AFB such as copper and aluminum, the involved Li diffusion mechanism in these materials remains poorly understood. Through first-principles calculation and stress-assisted diffusion equations, here we study the Li diffusion mechanism in several current collectors and related alloys and clarify the effect of volume expansion on Li diffusion respectively. It is suggested that due to the lower Li migration barriers in aluminum and tin, they should be more suitable to be used as AFB anodes, compared to copper, silver, and lead. The Li diffusion facilitation in copper with a certain number of vacancies is proposed to explain why the use of copper with a thickness 100 nm as the protective coating on the anode improves the lifetime of the batteries. We show that the volume expansion has a positive effect on Li diffusion via mechanical\textendash electrochemical coupling. Namely, the volume expansion caused by Li diffusion will further induce stress which in turn affects the diffusion. These findings not only provide in-depth insight into the operating principle of AFBs, but also open a new route toward design of improved anode through utilizing the positive effect of mechanical\textendash electrochemical coupling.},

  abstract = {Surrogate modeling and uncertainty quantification tasks for PDE systems are most often considered as supervised learning problems where input and output data pairs are used for training. The construction of such emulators is by definition a small data problem which poses challenges to deep learning approaches that have been developed to operate in the big data regime. Even in cases where such models have been shown to have good predictive capability in high dimensions, they fail to address constraints in the data implied by the PDE model. This paper provides a methodology that incorporates the governing equations of the physical model in the loss/likelihood functions. The resulting physics-constrained, deep learning models are trained without any labeled data (e.g. employing only input data) and provide comparable predictive responses with data-driven models while obeying the constraints of the problem at hand. This work employs a convolutional encoder-decoder neural network approach as well as a conditional flow-based generative model for the solution of PDEs, surrogate model construction, and uncertainty quantification tasks. The methodology is posed as a minimization problem of the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the model predictive density and the reference conditional density, where the later is defined as the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution at a given inverse temperature with the underlying potential relating to the PDE system of interest. The generalization capability of these models to out-of-distribution input is considered. Quantification and interpretation of the predictive uncertainty is provided for a number of problems.

  abstract = {Image-to-image translation is a class of vision and graphics problems where the goal is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image using a training set of aligned image pairs. However, for many tasks, paired training data will not be available. We present an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain X to a target domain Y in the absence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn a mapping G : X -{$>$} Y such that the distribution of images from G(X) is indistinguishable from the distribution Y using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping F : Y -{$>$} X and introduce a cycle consistency loss to push F(G(X)) approximate to X (and vice versa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired training data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object transfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.},
