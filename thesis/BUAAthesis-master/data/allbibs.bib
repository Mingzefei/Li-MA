  abstract = {Battery electrode surfaces are generally coated with electronically insulating solid films of thickness 1-50 nm. Both electrons and Li+ can move at the electrode-surface film interface in response to the voltage, which adds complexity to the ``electric double layer'' (EDL). We apply Density Functional Theory (DFT) to investigate how the applied voltage is manifested as changes in the EDL at atomic length scales, including charge separation and interfacial dipole moments. Illustrating examples include Li3PO4, Li2CO3, and LixMn2O4 thin films on Au(111) surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Adsorbed organic solvent molecules can strongly reduce voltages predicted in vacuum. We propose that manipulating surface dipoles, seldom discussed in battery studies, may be a viable strategy to improve electrode passivation. We also distinguish the computed potential governing electrons, which is the actual or instantaneous voltage, and the ``lithium cohesive energy''-based voltage governing Li content widely reported in DFT calculations, which is a slower-responding self-consistency criterion at interfaces. This distinction is critical for a comprehensive description of electrochemical activities on electrode surfaces, including Li+ insertion dynamics, parasitic electrolyte decomposition, and electrodeposition at overpotentials.},

  abstract = {Understanding of the electrical conduction, that is, ionic and electronic conduction, through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is critical to the design of durable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with high rate capability and long life. It is believed that an ideal SEI should not only be an ionic conductor, but also an electronic insulator. In this study, we present a theoretical design of an artificial SEI consisting of lithium fluoride (LiF) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) on a LIB anode based on a newly developed density functional theory (DFT) informed space charge model. We demonstrate that the migration of lattice Li ions from LiF phase to form Li interstitials in Li2CO3 is energetically favorable near the LiF/ Li2CO3 interface. At equilibrium, this interfacial defect reaction establishes a space charge potential across the interface, which causes the accumulation of ionic carriers but the depletion of electronic carriers near the LiF/Li2CO3 interface. To utilize this space charge effect, we propose a computationally designed, nanostructured artificial SEI structure with high density of interfaces of LiF and Li2CO3 perpendicular to the electrode. On the basis of this structure, the influences of grain size and volume ratio of the two phases were studied. Our results reveal that reducing the grain size of Li2CO3 in the nanostructured composite can promote ionic carriers and increase the ionic conductivity through the composite SEI by orders of magnitude. At the same time, the electronic conductivity is reduced due to electron depletion near the LiF/Li2CO3 interface. Furthermore, an optimal volume fraction that ensures high ionic and low electronic conduction was predicted.},

  abstract = {Me/LiX nanocomposites (Me e transition metal and X {$\frac{1}{4}$} F or O) exhibit extra lithium storage, with pseudo-capacitive behavior and high-rate performance. While LiX surface layers or the interfacial core serves as hosts for extra Li, atoms of contacting transition metal serve as electron sinks, depending on Me electronegativity. To verify the mechanism, we have performed comparative DFT-LCAO calculations on the polar TijLijLi2O(111) and non-polar CujLijLiF(001) interfaces with extra Li atoms inserted inside both 2D interfaces, gradually changing their concentration. Theoretical calculations confirm validity of this interfacial model for explanation of the extra storage capacity at low potentials. The diffusion barrier for extra Li atom along the Me/LiX interface is markedly smaller than the Li penetration barrier into the bulk.},

  abstract = {The mechanism of Li+ transport through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), a passivating film on electrode surfaces, has never been clearly elucidated despite its overwhelming importance to Li-ion battery operation and lifetime. The present paper develops a multiscale theoretical methodology to reveal the mechanism of Li+ transport in a SEI film. The methodology incorporates the boundary conditions of the first direct diffusion measurements on a model SEI consisting of porous (outer) organic and dense (inner) inorganic layers (similar to typical SEI films). New experimental evidence confirms that the inner layer in the {$\sim$}20 nm thick model SEI is primarily crystalline Li2CO3. Using density functional theory, we first determined that the dominant diffusion carrier in Li2CO3 below the voltage range of SEI formation is excess interstitial Li+. This diffuses via a knock-of f mechanism to maintain higher O-coordination, rather than direct-hopping through empty spaces in the Li2CO3 lattice. Mesoscale diffusion equations were then formulated upon a new two-layer/two-mechanism model: pore diffusion in the outer layer and knock-off diffusion in the inner layer. This diffusion model predicted the unusual isotope ratio 6Li+/7Li+ profile measured by TOF-SIMS, which increases from the SEI/electrolyte surface and peaks at a depth of 5 nm, and then gradually decreases within the dense layer. With no fitting parameters, our approach is applicable to model general transport properties, such as ionic conductivity, for SEI films on the surface of other electrodes, from the atomic scale to the mesoscale, as well as aging phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Understanding and improving Li transport through crystalline Li2CO3, a stable component of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) films in Li-ion batteries, is critical to battery rate performance, capacity drop, and power loss. Identification of the dominant diffusion carriers and their diffusion pathways in SEI films coated on anode and cathode surfaces is a necessary step toward the development of methods to increase Li conductivity. In this paper, we identify the dominant Li diffusion carriers in Li2CO3 over a voltage range (0-4.4 V) that includes typical anode and cathode materials by computing and comparing thermodynamics of all seven Li-associated point defects with density functional theory (DFT). The main diffusion carriers in Li2CO3 below 0.98 V are excess Li-ion interstitials; however, above 3.98 V, Li-ion vacancies become the dominant diffusion carrier type, and they have the same concentration in the voltage range of 0.98-3.98 V. Diffusion mechanisms of the main diffusion carriers were computed via the climbing image nudged elastic band method (CI-NEB). On the basis of the computed diffusion carrier concentration and diffusion barriers, the Li ionic conductivity was computed as a function of voltage, and it varies by {$\sim$}5 orders of magnitude. Insights gained from our calculations allow us to suggest different dopants to enhance Li conductivity in SEI films and propose a new mechanism for electron leakage through an SEI film into the electrolyte. Li2CO3 is the one of the main stable components in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in lithium-ion batteries and can be found in SEI films grown on both cathode and anode surfaces. On the basis of the concentrations and diffusion barriers computed for each of the identified point defects from first-principles calculations, the Li conductivity in Li2CO3 is mapped as a function of battery voltage. It is found that the diffusion carriers in the Li2CO3 on a negative electrode (graphite) are Li+ interstitials but changed to Li+ vacancies in the Li2CO3 coated on cathode materials. While Li+ vacancies diffuse via a typical direct hopping mechanism, the excess Li+ interstitials diffuse via repetitive knock-off with the Li+ ions on lattice sites. The Li+ interstitial conductivity in Li2CO3 on graphite is {$\sim$}5 orders of magnitude faster than that of a Li+ vacancy in Li2CO3 on the cathode. This suggests that Li transport through an SEI film on a cathode material can be dramatically different from Li transport through an SEI film on an anode material, despite the fact that SEI component chemistries appear to be similar in both cases. Thus, different doping strategies for the SEI on the anode and cathode could be taken to increase diffusion carrier concentrations in order to increase Li conductivity in an SEI film.},

  abstract = {The formation and continuous growth of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer are responsible for the irreversible capacity loss of batteries in the initial and subsequent cycles, respectively. In this article, the electron tunneling barriers from Li metal through three insulating SEI components, namely Li2CO3, LiF and Li3PO4, are computed by density function theory (DFT) approaches. Based on electron tunneling theory, it is estimated that sufficient to block electron tunneling. It is also found that the band gap decreases under tension while the work function remains the same, and thus the tunneling barrier decreases under tension and increases under compression. A new parameter, h, characterizing the average distances between anions, is proposed to unify the variation of band gap with strain under different loading conditions into a single linear function of h. An analytical model based on the tunneling results is developed to connect the irreversible capacity loss, due to the Li ions consumed in forming these SEI component layers on the surface of negative electrodes. The agreement between the model predictions and experimental results suggests that only the initial irreversible capacity loss is due to the self-limiting electron tunneling property of the SEI.},

We have considered SEI growth on both Li metal surfaces and using a simulation framework that allows us to vary the Li surface density on the anode surface. Using our simulations we have obtained the detailed structure and distribution of different constituents in the SEI as a function of the distance from the anode surfaces. We find that SEI films formed in the presence of EC are rich in Li2CO3 and Li2O, while LiOCH3 is the primary constituent of DMC films. We find that dilithium ethylene dicarbonate, LiEDC, is formed in the presence of EC at low Li surface densities, but it quickly decomposes to inorganic salts during subsequent growth in Li rich environments. The surface films formed in our simulations have a multilayer structure with regions rich in inorganic and organic salts located near the anode surface and the electrolyte interface, respectively, in agreement with depth profiling experiments. Our computed formation potentials 1.0 V vs. Li/Li+ is also in excellent accord with experimental measurements. We have also calculated the elastic stiffness of the SEI films; we find that they are significantly stiffer than Li metal, but are somewhat more compliant compared to the graphite anode.},

Improvements in efficiency and cycling stability over baseline electrolytes in lithium (Li)               versus               copper (Cu) cells were directly correlated to the initial Li-nucleation process, as observed               via               cryogenic-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) prepared cross sections, which revealed that Li films deposited with the bisalt electrolyte were significantly thinner and denser than those from the baseline. This behavior was further traced back to the initial nucleation process               via               cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), which shows stark differences in the morphology and conformality of deposited Li as a function of electrolyte chemistry. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated that the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed from the bisalt electrolyte primarily consists of larger anion fragments, suggesting that the anion chemistry strongly influences the extent of reduction and resulting surface chemistry.               Ab initio               DFT-based and force field-based molecular dynamics calculations revealed the complex interplay (positioning, orientation, reactivity, kinetics) between the FSI               -               and TFSI               -               anions in the double layer at both electrode\textendash electrolyte interfaces and the ramifications for stabilizing these interfaces. As a result of the unique interphasial chemistry brought by this bisalt system, this electrolyte supports an unprecedented (for an ether-based electrolyte) capacity retention ({$>$}88\%) after 300 cycles ({$\sim$}2 months of cycling) in a 4.4 V NMC622-Li cell, and a {$>$}30\% improvement in capacity retention over baseline after 50 cycles in 4.4 V NMC622-Cu ``anode-free'' cells. Altogether, these results provide new insight into how the bisalt effect can be leveraged for regulating the timescale, chemistry, and extent of interfacial reactions. When balanced properly, this promotes efficient plating/deplating of Li, and potentially supports widespread implementation of high nickel content NMC cell configurations with limited or no excess lithium.},

  abstract = {Insight is given on the type of ion-pairs that could be formed in EC/DMC by Li-salts LiTDI, LiFSI and LiPF               6               .                        ,                             New lithium salts such as lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) and lithium 4,5-dicyano-2-(trifluoromethyl)imidazole-1-ide (LiTDI) are now challenging lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF               6               ), the most used electrolyte salt in commercial Li-ion batteries. Thus it is now important to establish a comparison of these electrolyte components in a standard solvent mixture of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate (EC/DMC: 50/50 wt\%). With this aim, transport properties, such as the ionic conductivity, viscosity and               7               Li self-diffusion coefficient have been deeply investigated. Moreover, as these properties are directly linked to the nature of the interionic interactions and ion solvation, a better understanding of the structural properties of electrolytes can be obtained. The Li salt concentration has been varied over the range of 0.1 mol L               -1               to 2 mol L               -1               at 25 \textdegree C and the working temperature from 20 \textdegree C to 80 \textdegree C at the fixed concentration of 1 mol L               -1               . Experimental results were used to investigate the temperature dependence of the salt ion-pair (IP) dissociation coefficient (               {$\alpha$}               D               ) with the help of the Walden rule and the Nernst\textendash Einstein equation. The lithium cation effective solute radius (               r               Li               ) has been determined using the Jones\textendash Dole\textendash Kaminsky equation coupled to the Einstein relation for the viscosity of hard spheres in solution and the Stokes\textendash Einstein equation. From the variations of               {$\alpha$}               D               and r               Li               with the temperature, it is inferred that in EC/DMC LiFSI forms solvent-shared ion-pairs (SIP) and that, LiTDI and LiPF               6               are likely to form solvent separated ion-pairs (S               2               IP) or a mixture of SIP and S               2               IP. From the temperature dependence of               {$\alpha$}               D               , thermodynamic parameters such as the standard Gibbs free energy, enthalpy and entropy for the ion-pair formation are obtained. Besides being in agreement with the information provided by the variations of               {$\alpha$}               D               and r               Li               , it is concluded that the ion-pair formation process is exergonic and endothermic for the three salts in EC/DMC.},

During discharge, a cell plates the metal of an anode of high-energy Fermi level such as lithium or sodium onto a cathode current collector with a low-energy Fermi level; the voltage of the cell may be determined by a cathode redox center having an energy between the Fermi levels of the anode and that of the cathode current collector. This strategy is demonstrated with a solid electrolyte that not only is wet by the metallic anode, but also has a dielectric constant capable of creating a large electric-double-layer capacitance at the two electrode/electrolyte interfaces. The result is a safe, low-cost, lithium or sodium rechargeable battery of high energy density and long cycle life.},

  abstract = {The lithium metal anode is one of the key components of the lithium\textendash sulfur (Li\textendash S) batteries, which are considered one of the most promising candidates for the next generation of battery systems.           ,                             The lithium metal anode is one of the key components of the lithium\textendash sulfur (Li\textendash S) batteries, which are considered one of the most promising candidates for the next generation of battery systems. However, one of the main challenges that have prevented Li-metal anodes from becoming feasible to be used in commercial batteries is the continuous decomposition of the electrolyte due to its high reactivity, which leads to the formation of solid\textendash electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. The properties of the SEI can dramatically affect the performance of the batteries. Thus, a rigorous understanding of the electrolyte decomposition is crucial to elucidate improvements in performance of the Li\textendash S technology. In this work, using density functional theory (DFT) and               ab initio               molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD), we investigate the effect of electron-rich environments on the decomposition mechanism of electrolyte species in pure 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) solvent and 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) salt solutions. It is found that systems with pure DME require an average environment of at least {$\sim$}0.9 |               e               | per molecule for a DME to decompose into CH               3               O               -               and C               2               H               4               2-               via               a 4-electron transfer. In the case of mixtures, the salts are very prone to react with any excess of electrons. In addition, DME dehydrogenation due to reactions with fragments coming from the salt decompositions was detected. Formation of oligomer anionic species from DME and salt fragments were also identified from the AIMD simulations. Finally, the thermodynamics and kinetics of the most relevant electrolyte decomposition reactions were characterized. DME decomposition reactions predicted from the AIMD simulations were found to be thermodynamically favorable under exposure to Li atoms and/or by reactions with salt fragments. In most cases, these reactions were shown to have low to moderate activation barriers.},

  abstract = {Due to their high energy density and reduced cost, lithium-sulfur batteries are promising alternatives for applications such as electrical vehicles. However, a number of technical challenges need to be overcome in order to make them feasible for commercial uses. These challenges arise from the battery highly interconnected chemistry, which besides the electrochemical reactions includes side reactions at both electrodes and migration of soluble polysulfide (PS) species produced at the cathode to the anode side. The presence of such PS species alters the already complex reactivity of the Li anode. In this work, interfacial reactions occurring at the surface of Li metal anodes due to electrochemical instability of the electrolyte components and PS species are investigated with density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics methods. It is found that the bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt reacts very fast when in contact with the Li surface, and anion decomposition precedes salt dissociation. The anion decomposition mechanisms are fully elucidated. Two of the typical solvents used in Li-S technology, 1,3-dioxolane and 1,2dimethoxyethane, are found stable during the entire simulation length, in contrast with the case of ethylene carbonate that is rapidly decomposed by sequential 2- or 4-electron mechanisms. On the other hand, the fast reactivity of the soluble PS species alters the side reactions because the PS totally decomposes before any of the electrolyte components forming Li2S on the anode surface.},

However, the high reactivity of alkali metal toward organic solvents and salts renders inevitable side reactions, which further leads to undesirable electrolyte depletion, cell failure, and evolution of flammable gas. In this work, first-principles calculations, in combination with in situ optical microscopic observations, are employed to unveil the mechanism of organic electrolyte decomposition and gas evolution on Na metal anode. Once complexed with Na ions, solvent molecules exhibit a significantly reduced the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level, facilitating the electrolyte decomposition and gas evolution. Such a general mechanism is also applicable to Li and other metal anodes. This work uncovers the critical role of ion-solvent complexation in stability of alkali metal anodes, reveals the nature of electrolyte gassing, and provides a mechanistic guidance to electrolyte and Li/Na anode design for safe rechargeable batteries.},

  abstract = {Lithium (Li) metal battery is strongly considered as one of the potential candidates for next-generation energy storage devices due to its ultrahigh energy density. However, gas evolution induced by spontaneous decomposition of organic electrolytes during cell cycling leads to the capacity decay and safety issues of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, the gas evolution behavior in a working Li-sulfur (Li-S) battery based on the most widely used 1,3-dioxolane (DOL)/1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) electrolyte was probed through gas phase chromatography, mass spectrum of as-produced gas in pouch cells, as well as the first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics. An adsorption-to-reaction mechanism that DOL/DME firstly adsorbed lithium and then decomposed was proposed and verified. DOL with a small decomposition barrier was found to be easily decomposed into ethylene. When the DME:DOL ratio in the organic of Li-S cell was increased, a high and long discharge plateau as well as a large discharge capacity were observed. We also protected Li metal anode to avoid the direct contact between electrolyte and fresh Li metal through the polysulfide additives. The asobtained cell afforded few gas evolution and consequently a long cycling life. This understanding sheds fresh light of ultra-long cycling life of Li-S pouch cell from the viewpoint of stable electrolyte based on theoretical predictions and experimental verifications, which can be extended to other LMBs based on multi-electron redox reactions.},

In this Review, we present a critical overview of a wide range of post-LIB materials and systems that could have a pivotal role in meeting such demands. We divide battery systems into two categories: near-term and long-term technologies. To provide a realistic and balanced perspective, we describe the operating principles and remaining issues of each post-LIB technology, and also evaluate these materials under commercial cell configurations.},

The [F-H-F]               -               ion represents a bare short H-bond, whose distinctive vibrational potential in water is revealed with femtosecond two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy. It shows the superharmonic behavior of the proton motion, which is strongly coupled to the donor-acceptor stretching and disappears on H-bond bending. In combination with high-level quantum-chemical calculations, we demonstrate a distinct crossover in spectroscopic properties from conventional to short strong H-bonds, which identify where hydrogen bonding ends and chemical bonding begins.},

A total of 42 HB complexes constructed from 28 neutral and 14 charged monomers were considered. This set was designed to sample a wide range of HB strengths to obtain a complete view about HBs. BEs were derived with the accurate coupled cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples correction (CCSD(T))(T) method and the physical components of the BE were investigated by symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT). Quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules (QTAIM) descriptors and other HB indices were calculated based on high-quality density functional theory wave functions. We propose a new and rigorous classification of H-bonds (HBs) based on the SAPT decomposition. Neutral complexes are either classified as ``very weak'' HBs with a BE {$\geq$} -2.5 kcal/mol that are mainly dominated by both dispersion and electrostatic interactions or as ``weak-to-medium'' HBs with a BE varying between -2.5 and -14.0 kcal/mol that are only dominated by electrostatic interactions. On the other hand, charged complexes are divided into ``medium'' HBs with a BE in the range of -11.0 to -15.0 kcal/mol, which are mainly dominated by electrostatic interactions, or into ``strong'' HBs whose BE is more negative than -15.0 kcal/mol, which are mainly dominated by electrostatic together with induction interactions. Among various explored correlations between BEs and wave function-based HB descriptors, a fairly satisfactory correlation was found for the electron density at the bond critical point (BCP; {$\rho$}BCP) of HBs. The fitted equation for neutral complexes is BE/kcal/mol = - 223.08 \texttimes{} {$\rho$}BCP/a. u. + 0.7423 with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 14.7\%, while that for charged complexes is BE/kcal/mol = - 332.34 \texttimes{} {$\rho$}BCP/a. u. - 1.0661 with a MAPE of 10.0\%. In practice, these equations may be used for a quick estimation of HB BEs, for example, for intramolecular HBs or large HB networks in biomolecules. \textcopyright{} 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Enjoying great safety, high power, and high energy densities, all-solid-state batteries play a key role in the next generation energy storage devices. However, their development is limited by the lack of solid electrolyte materials that can reach the practically useful conductivities of 10               -2               S/cm at room temperature (RT). Here, by exploring a set of lithium-rich antiperovskites composed of cluster ions, we report a lithium superionic conductor, Li               3               SBF               4               , that has an estimated 3D RT conductivity of 10               -2               S/cm, a low activation energy of 0.210 eV, a giant band gap of 8.5 eV, a small formation energy, a high melting point, and desired mechanical properties. A mixed phase of the material, Li               3               S(BF               4               )               0.5               Cl               0.5               , with the same simple crystal structure exhibits an RT conductivity as high as 10               -1               S/cm and a low activation energy of 0.176 eV. The high ionic conductivity of the crystals is enabled by the thermal-excited vibrational modes of the cluster ions and the large channel size created by mixing the large cluster ion with the small elementary ion.},

  abstract = {Rechargeable lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with an ultrahigh theoretical energy density have attracted more and more attentions for their crucial applications of portable electronic devices, electric vehicles, and smart grids. However, the implementation of LMBs in practice is still facing numerous challenges, such as low Coulombic efficiency, poor cycling performance, and complicated interfacial reactions. First-principles calculations have become a powerful technique in lithium battery research field, in terms of modeling the structures and properties of specific electrode materials, understanding the charge/discharge mechanisms at the atomic scale, and delivering rational design strategies for electrode materials as well as electrolytes. In this review, theoretical studies on sulfur cathodes, oxygen cathodes, lithium metal anodes, and solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) of LMBs are summarized. A brief introduction of simulation methods is offered at first. The next two chapters mainly focus on issues concerning cathodes of LMBs. Then the theoretical researches on the Li metal anode and SSEs are particularly reviewed. The current challenges and potential research directions in each field of LMBs are prospected from a theoretical viewpoint.},

  abstract = {The performance of organometallic perovskite solar cells has rapidly surpassed that of both conventional dye-sensitized and organic photovoltaics. High-power conversion efficiency can be realized in both mesoporous and thin-film device architectures. We address the origin of this success in the context of the materials chemistry and physics of the bulk perovskite as described by electronic structure calculations. In addition to the basic optoelectronic properties essential for an efficient photovoltaic device (spectrally suitable band gap, high optical absorption, low carrier effective masses), the materials are structurally and compositionally flexible. As we show, hybrid perovskites exhibit spontaneous electric polarization; we also suggest ways in which this can be tuned through judicious choice of the organic cation. The presence of ferroelectric domains will result in internal junctions that may aid separation of photoexcited electron and hole pairs, and reduction of recombination through segregation of charge carriers. The combination of high dielectric constant and low effective mass promotes both Wannier-Mott exciton separation and effective ionization of donor and acceptor defects. The photoferroic effect could be exploited in nanostructured films to generate a higher open circuit voltage and may contribute to the current\textendash voltage hysteresis observed in perovskite solar cells.},

A number of 49 compositions were synthesized and their crystal structures, relative density of the sintered material, and Li-ion conductivity characterized. The co-doped compositions had a higher Li-ion conductivity than those doped with CaO or Y               2               O               3               alone. Furthermore, diffraction studies revealed that two phases and an impurity phase existed depending on the composition. Adding CaO significantly changed the relative density of the sintered material. Thus, to identify compositional dependencies among the Li-ion conductivity, phase stability, and relative density was complicated, and intuitively searching for the best composition was difficult. As a proof-of-concept, the collected data were used to demonstrate that the Bayesian optimization (BO) significantly improved the experimental search for the best oxide-based electrolyte composition. Multi-objective BO (MOBO), which considers more than two target performances, was also carried out. It was validated that the BO-guided experimental search determined more rapidly the best composition compared to conventional trial-and-error approaches employed in the materials industry.},

However, it is not yet understood why only a few materials can deliver exceptionally higher ionic conductivity than typical solids or how one can design fast ion conductors following simple principles. Using ab initio modelling, here we show that fast diffusion in super-ionic conductors does not occur through isolated ion hopping as is typical in solids, but instead proceeds through concerted migrations of multiple ions with low energy barriers. Furthermore, we elucidate that the low energy barriers of the concerted ionic diffusion are a result of unique mobile ion configurations and strong mobile ion interactions in super-ionic conductors. Our results provide a general framework and universal strategy to design solid materials with fast ionic diffusion.},

The strong anchoring of intermediates is widely accepted to retard the shuttle of polysulfides in a working battery. However, the understanding of the intrinsic chemistry is still deficient. Inspired by the concept of hydrogen bond, herein we focus on the Li bond chemistry in Li\textendash S batteries through sophisticated quantum chemical calculations, in combination with 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Identified as Li bond, the strong dipole\textendash dipole interaction between Li polysulfides and Li\textendash S cathode materials originates from the electron-rich donors (e.g., pyridinic nitrogen (pN)), and enhanced by the inductive and conjugative effect of scaffold materials with {$\pi$}-electrons (e.g., graphene). The chemical shift of Li polysulfides in 7Li NMR, being both theoretically predicted and experimentally verified, is suggested to serve as a quantitative descriptor of Li bond strength. These theoretical insights were further proved by actual electrochemical tests. This work highlights the importance of Li bond chemistry in Li\textendash S cell and provides a deep comprehension, which is helpful to the cathode materials rational design and practical applications of Li\textendash S batteries.},

  abstract = {Lithium-metal anode batteries have the potential to serve as nextgeneration, high energy density batteries with high specific capacity and low electrode potential. However, due to the high reactivity of lithium, complex interfacial reactions and uncontrollable dendrite growth obstruct their application. These lithium-metal anode interfacial reactions are often accompanied by the organic electrolyte spontaneously decomposing and combustible gas subsequently escaping, which is a safety concern. It also affects the form of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which is important for stabilizing the interface between the Li-metal anode and electrolyte. Uncontrollable Li dendrite growth could penetrate the separator or electrolyte, creating the risk of a short circuit. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the lithium nucleation and deposition processes. Solid state electrolytes (SSEs) have also attracted attention for improving the energy density and safety of Li-ion batteries; however, problems such as poor ionic conductivity still exist. Computational simulations, such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and first-principles calculations based on density function theory (DFT), can help elucidate reaction mechanisms, explore electrode materials, and optimize battery design. In this review, we summarize the theoretical perspective gained from computational simulation studies of lithium-metal anodes. This review is organized into four sections: interfacial reactions, SEIs, lithium nucleation, and SSEs. We first explore organic-electrolyte interfacial reaction mechanisms that were revealed through MD simulations and how electrolyte additives, electrolyte concentration, operating temperature affect them. For SEI, DFT can provide an in-depth understanding of the surface chemical reaction, surface morphology, electrochemical properties, and kinetic characteristics of SEI. We review the developments in SEI transmission mechanisms and SEI materials' properties alteration by lithium metal. We further explore artificial SEI design requirements and compare the performances of artificial SEIs, including double-layer, fluorine-, and sulfur-SEIs. Lithium dendrite growth as a result of lithium nucleation and deposition is then discussed, focusing on computational studies that evaluated how doped graphene, 3D carbon fibers, porous metals, and other matrix materials regulated these processes and inhibited dendrite growth. Computational simulations evaluating transport phenomena and interface reactions between SSEs and lithium-metal anodes are then explored, followed by ideas for further design optimization. Finally, potential research directions and perspectives in this field are proposed and discussed.},

Considering the high cost and complication of the currently reported approaches to suppress the Li dendrite growth, in this study we have modified a low-cost commercial three-dimensional (3D) Cu foam into a high-performance host for stable Li deposition by the growth of Cu               2               S nanowires (NWs) inside the Cu framework. The Cu               2               S NWs were grown by a simple and scalable chemical approach, and they reduce the local current density and homogenize the Li ion distribution because of the increased contact area of the 3D Cu               2               S NWs/Cu with the electrolyte. They also enable the formation of a protective solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film containing Li               2               S               2               /Li               2               S. The prepared 3D Cu               2               S NWs/Cu current collector enables dendrite-free Li deposition/stripping and gives a stable cycling performance with a high coulombic efficiency (95.5\% for more than 150 cycles at 2 mA cm               -2               ). Full cells with LiFePO               4               as the cathode also exhibit improved cycling stability and improved coulombic efficiency, showing the potential of this host in the use of stable Li metal anodes.},

Three dendrite growth mechanisms are observed: (1) electrochemical shielding, where there is practically no electrodeposition/electrodissolution; (2) stress-induced electrodissolution and electrodeposition on those interfaces directly facing each other, generating a self-sustained overpotential that pushes the dendrites towards the counter electrode; and (3) local, lateral plastic extrusion in those side branches experiencing non-hydrostatic stresses. Six regimes of lithium electrodeposit growth are identified: (i) thermodynamic suppression regime, (ii) incubation regime, (iii) base-controlled regime, (iv) tip-controlled regime, (v) mixed regime, and (vi) Sand's regime.},

  abstract = {Atomistic simulations are employed to screen experimental structural repositories for fast Li-ion conductors, finding new candidate solid-state electrolyte materials.           ,              We present a computational screening of experimental structural repositories for fast Li-ion conductors, with the goal of finding new candidate materials for application as solid-state electrolytes in next-generation batteries. We start from {$\sim$}1400 unique Li-containing materials, of which {$\sim$}900 are insulators at the level of density-functional theory. For those, we calculate the diffusion coefficient in a highly automated fashion, using extensive molecular dynamics simulations on a potential energy surface (the recently published pinball model) fitted on first-principles forces. The {$\sim$}130 most promising candidates are studied with full first-principles molecular dynamics, including an estimate of the activation barrier for the most diffusive structures. The results of the first-principles simulations of the candidate solid-state electrolytes found are discussed in detail.},

  abstract = {The Li metal anode is considered the most promising anode for nextgeneration high energy density batteries owing to its high theoretical capacity and low electrode potential. The development of batteries with high energy density is essential to meet the growing demand for energy storage devices in the modern world. However, the Li metal anode has operational problems. The high activity of Li causes dendritic growth during the cycling process, which leads to the cracking of the SEI (solid-electrolyte interphase), increased side reactions, and formation of dead Li. Furthermore, if the growth of Li dendrites is left uncontrolled, it can penetrate the separator and create a short-circuit accompanied by thermal runaway. Additionally, the complete utilization of active Li is challenged by the infinite volume expansion of the Li anode. To improve the application scope of Li metal batteries, it is imperative to develop advanced strategies for inhibiting Li dendritic growth, enhancing the stability of the SEI, reducing the accumulation of dead Li, and buffering the volume expansion. Understanding the mechanisms and models of Li nucleation and growth provides insight into solving these problems. This review summarizes some of the important models of Li nucleation and growth such as the surface nucleating model, charge-induced model, SEI model, and deposition/dissolution model. These models aid comprehension of the Li nucleation and growth process under various conditions. This review also discusses the strategies explored in the literature for improving the electrodes (such as three-dimensional (3D) matrix), electrolyte, SEI, and separator to realize uniform deposition of Li and improved utilization of Li. The 3D matrix strategy for improving the electrode design explores various matrices including graphene-based, carbon fiber-based, porous metal-based, and powder-based for buffering the volume expansion and reducing the local current density. To improve the electrolyte, concentrated lithium salts and functional additives are employed to stabilize the SEI and inhibit dendritic growth by regulating the chemical composition of SEI and inducing the deposition of Li. With respect to improving the design of the SEI, strategies for the construction of inorganic or organic components with high ionic conductivity and stable structure are explored for even distribution of Li ions and to avoid SEI rupture. This can reduce electrolyte consumption and dead Li formation. The modification of the separator by functional nanocarbon layer can control the direction of dendritic growth, thereby preventing the penetration of dendrites into the separator and achieving a uniform Li deposition layer. Finally, all solid state Li metal batteries (ASSLMBs) are discussed that utilize ceramic and polymer electrolytes owing to high safety of the solid state electrolyte. Therefore, reducing the interfacial resistance and suppressing dendritic growth between the Li anode and the electrolyte is key for the practical applications of ASSLMBs. Overall, this review provides a summary and outlook for promoting the practical applications of Li metal batteries.},

  abstract = {Lithiated Si anodes facilitate reduction of carbonate additives through multiple electron transfers.           ,                             Solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers are films deposited on the surface of Li-ion battery electrodes during battery charge and discharge processes. They are due to electrochemical instability of the electrolyte which causes electron transfer from (to) the anode (cathode) surfaces. The films could have a protective passivating role and therefore understanding the detailed reduction (oxidation) processes is essential. Here density functional theory and               ab initio               molecular dynamics simulations are used to investigate the reduction mechanisms of vinylene carbonate (VC) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) on lithiated silicon surfaces. These species are frequently used as ``additives'' to improve the SEI properties. It is found that on lithiated Si anodes (with low to intermediate degrees of lithiation) VC may be reduced               via               a 2e               -               mechanism yielding an opened VC               2-               anion. At higher degrees of lithiation, such a species receives two extra electrons from the surface resulting in an adsorbed CO               2-               (ads)               anion and a radical anion \textperiodcentered OC               2               H               2               O               2-               . Additionally, in agreement with experimental observations, it is shown that CO               2               can be generated from reaction of VC with the CO               3               2-               anion, a product of the reduction of the main solvent, ethylene carbonate (EC). On the other hand, FEC reduction on Li               x               Si               y               surfaces is found to be independent of the degree of lithiation, and occurs through three mechanisms. One of them leads to an adsorbed VC               2-               anion upon release from the FEC molecule and adsorption on the surface of F               -               and one H atom. Thus in some cases, the reduction of FEC may lead to the exact same reduction products as that of VC, which explains similarities in SEI layers formed in the presence of these additives. However, FEC may be reduced               via               two other multi-electron transfer mechanisms that result in formation of either CO               2               2-               , F               -               , and \textperiodcentered CH               2               CHO               -               or CO               2-               , F               -               , and \textperiodcentered OCH               2               CHO               -               . These alternative reduction products may oligomerize and form SEI layers with different components than those formed in the presence of VC. In all cases, FEC reduction also leads to formation of LiF moieties on the anode surface, in agreement with reported experimental data. The crucial role of the surface in each of these mechanisms is thoroughly explained.},

  abstract = {On the basis of extensive studies of synthetic perovskite-structured compounds it is possible to derive a hierarchy of hettotype structures which are derivatives of the arisotypic cubic perovskite structure (ABX3), exemplified by SrTiO3 (tausonite) or KMgF3 ( parascandolaite) by: (1) tilting and distortion of the BX6 octahedra; (2) ordering of A- and B-site cations; (3) formation of A-, B- or X-site vacancies. This hierarchical scheme can be applied to some naturally-occurring oxides, fluorides, hydroxides, chlorides, arsenides, intermetallic compounds and silicates which adopt such derivative crystal structures. Application of this hierarchical scheme to naturally-occurring minerals results in the recognition of a perovskite supergroup which is divided into stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric perovskite groups, with both groups further divided into single ABX3 or double A2BB{${'}$}X6 perovskites. Subgroups, and potential subgroups, of stoichiometric perovskites include: (1) silicate single perovskites of the bridgmanite subgroup; (2) oxide single perovskites of the perovskite subgroup (tausonite, perovskite, loparite, lueshite, isolueshite, lakargiite, megawite); (3) oxide single perovskites of the macedonite subgroup which exhibit second order Jahn-Teller distortions (macedonite, barioperovskite); (4) fluoride single perovskites of the neighborite subgroup (neighborite, parascandolaite); (5) chloride single perovskites of the chlorocalcite subgroup; (6) B-site cation ordered double fluoride perovskites of the cryolite subgroup (cryolite, elpasolite, simmonsite); (7) B-site cation ordered oxide double perovskites of the vapnikite subgroup [vapnikite, (?) latrappite]. Non-stoichiometric perovskites include: (1) A-site vacant double hydroxides, or hydroxide perovskites, belonging to the s\"ohngeite, schoenfliesite and stottite subgroups; (2) Anion-deficient perovskites of the brownmillerite subgroup (srebrodolskite, shulamitite); (3) A-site vacant quadruple perovskites (skutterudite subgroup); (4) B-site vacant single perovskites of the oskarssonite subgroup [oskarssonite]; (5) B-site vacant inverse single perovskites of the cohenite and auricupride subgroups; (6) B-site vacant double perovskites of the diaboleite subgroup; (7) anion-deficient partly-inverse B-site quadruple perovskites of the hematophanite subgroup.},

  abstract = {Lithium\textendash sulfur batteries (Li\textendash S) are considered the most promising systems for next-generation energy storage devices due to their high theoretical energy density and relatively low cost.           ,                             Lithium\textendash sulfur batteries (Li\textendash S) are considered the most promising systems for next-generation energy storage devices due to their high theoretical energy density and relatively low cost. However, the practical applications of Li\textendash S batteries are hindered by the poor electronic conductivity of sulfur and capacity degradation resulting from the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Herein, we demonstrate use of a tin-sulfide (SnS               2               ) modified separator to facilitate the redox reaction involving LiPS intermediates and realize improved electrochemical performance in a Li\textendash S battery. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that SnS               2               exhibits a strong affinity with LiPSs and induces a rapid conversion of trapped polysulfides. As a result, Li\textendash S batteries with a SnS               2               -modified separator exhibited an enhanced specific capacity of 1300 mA h g               -1               at 0.2C (corresponding to a high areal capacity of 4.03 mA h cm               -2               ), which was maintained at 1040 mA h g               -1               after 150 cycles. Furthermore, an excellent rate capability is achieved with a capacity of 700 mA h g               -1               (2.17 mA h cm               -2               ) at 5C. Additionally, the modified separator exhibited excellent cycling performance up to 500 cycles at 2C, with a low capacity decay rate of 0.0710\% per cycle. The excellent performance of the sulfur electrode is mainly attributed to the incorporation of the SnS               2               coating layer on the separator, which effectively confines polysulfides               via               both chemical and physical interaction and rapidly improves lithium ion diffusion. Moreover, the SnS               2               coating layer greatly improves sulfur utilization and efficiently accelerates the kinetic conversion of trapped polysulfides.},

After allowing for shell effects, an even-odd correction and a congruence energy (``Wigner Term''), six of the seven parameters were fitted to 1654 ground state masses of nuclei with N, Z {$>$} 8, together with a constraint that ensures agreement with measured values of the nuclear surface diffuseness. The RMS deviation in the fit to masses was 0.655 MeV, and the calculated values exhibit no drastic discrepancies even for A = 3. Calculated sizes of nuclear charge distributions agree closely with measurements. Calculated fission barriers were compared with 40 measured values down to 75Br. For Z {$>$} 88 the agreement is almost perfect. For Z {$<$} 88 the trend of the measurements seems to confirm the expectation that the congruence energy should double its magnitude for strongly necked-in saddle-point shapes. A seventh (density-dependence) parameter in the effective interaction can be adjusted to ensure fair agreement with the measured energy-dependence of the optical model potential in the range from - 70 MeV to 180 MeV.},

However, the most widely used CH3NH3PbI3 suffers from its poor stability and inclusion of toxic lead. In order to screen potential ABX3 candidate materials for solar cell applications, first-principles calculations have been performed for 90 organic-inorganic ABX3 perovskites with A cation to be one of CH3NH3, CH3CH2NH3 and CH2(NH2)2 molecules, B cation from Cd, Cu, Ge, Mg, Ni, Pb, Sn, Ti, V and Zn, and the X monovalent anion from Cl, Br and I. Some potential absorber materials with a 3D perovskite structure have been identified by using the calculated decomposition enthalpies, band gaps, and optimized atomic structures. The structural factor screening is found to be not decisive since the electronic effects are not taken into account. Furthermore, by doping at the B or X sites with a proper concentration, it is possible to improve the stability and optimize the band gap of perovskite materials. Since the present calculations are conducted for small monovalent organic molecules and the tetragonal perovskites, the present theoretical results should provide a useful guidance for designing the organic-inorganic perovskite solar cell absorbers.},

  abstract = {Optoelectronic properties of CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocubes (NCs) depend strongly on the interaction of the organic passivating molecules with the inorganic crystal. To understand this interaction, we employed a combination of synchrotron-based X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and first-principles density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations. Variable energy XPS elucidated the internal structure of the inorganic part in a layer-by-layer fashion, whereas NMR characterized the organic ligands. Our experimental results confirm that oleylammonium ions act as capping ligands by substituting Cs+ ions from the surface of CsPbBr3 NCs. DFT calculations shows that the substitution mechanism does not require much energy for surface reconstruction and, in contrast, stabilizes the nanocrystal by the formation of three hydrogen bonds between the -NH3+ moiety of oleylammonium and surrounding Br\textendash{} on the surface of NCs. This substitution mechanism and its origin are in stark contrast to the usual adsorption of organic ligands on the surface of typical NCs.},

To be useful for batteries, high performance solid state electrolyte materials must satisfy many requirements at once, an optimization that is difficult to perform experimentally or with computationally expensive               ab initio               techniques. We first screen 12\,831 lithium containing crystalline solids for those with high structural and chemical stability, low electronic conductivity, and low cost. We then develop a data-driven ionic conductivity classification model using logistic regression for identifying which candidate structures are likely to exhibit fast lithium conduction based on experimental measurements reported in the literature. The screening reduces the list of candidate materials from 12\,831 down to 21 structures that show promise as electrolytes, few of which have been examined experimentally. We discover that none of our simple atomistic descriptor functions alone provide predictive power for ionic conductivity, but a multi-descriptor model can exhibit a useful degree of predictive power. We also find that screening for structural stability, chemical stability and low electronic conductivity eliminates 92.2\% of all Li-containing materials and screening for high ionic conductivity eliminates a further 93.3\% of the remainder. Our screening utilizes structures and electronic information contained in the Materials Project database.},

To efficiently design functional electrolytes for lithium batteries, it is particularly important to understand the relative solvating ability of each individual organic solvent, because most of the electrolyte systems are comprised of two or more electrolyte solvents. Using a newly developed internally referenced diffusion-ordered spectroscopy technique and diffusion coefficient\textendash coordination ratio (               D               \textendash{}               {$\alpha$}               ) analysis, we successfully constructed a solvating power series for common electrolyte solvents. We demonstrated the usefulness of this solvating power series in designing more reliable electrolyte system by selecting an appropriate fluorinated electrolyte solvent for a high-voltage lithium metal battery (LMB) as an example. For a methyl(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)carbonate-based electrolyte, we identified fluoroethylene carbonate as a more desirable cyclic carbonate co-solvent than difluoroethylene carbonate for LMB due to its significantly higher ability to solvate lithium ions.},

The molecule\textendash cage interaction influences phase stability, phase transformations, and the molecular dynamics. We examine the hydrogen bonding in four AmBX3 formate perovskites: [Am]Zn(HCOO)3, with Am+ = hydrazinium (NH2NH3+), guanidinium (C(NH2)3+), dimethylammonium (CH3)2NH2+, and azetidinium (CH2)3NH2+. We develop a scheme to quantify the strength of hydrogen bonding in these systems from first-principles, which separates the electrostatic interactions between the amine (Am+) and the BX3\textendash{} cage. The hydrogen-bonding strengths of formate perovskites range from 0.36 to 1.40 eV/cation (8\textendash 32 kcalmol\textendash 1). Complementary solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirms that strong hydrogen bonding hinders cation mobility. Application of the procedure to hybrid lead halide perovskites (X = Cl, Br, I, Am+ = CH3NH3+, CH(NH2)2+) shows that these compounds have significantly weaker hydrogen-bonding energies of 0.09 to 0.27 eV/cation (2\textendash 6 kcalmol\textendash 1), correlating with lower order\textendash disorder transition temperatures.},

  abstract = {The CH3NH3PbI3 (methylammonium lead triiodide) perovskite semiconductor system has been viewed as a blockbuster research material during the last five years. Because of its complicated architecture, several of its technological, physical and geometrical issues have been examined many times. Yet this has not assisted in overcoming a number of problems in the field nor in enabling the material to be marketed. For instance, these studies have not clarified the nature and type of hydrogen bonding and other noncovalent interactions involved; the origin of hysteresis; the actual role of the methylammonium cation; the nature of polarity associated with the tetragonal geometry; the unusual origin of various frontier orbital contributions to the conduction band minimum; the underlying phenomena of spin-orbit coupling that causes significant bandgap reduction; and the nature of direct-to-indirect bandgap transition features. Arising from many recent reports, it is now a common belief that the I{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}H\textendash N interaction formed between the inorganic framework and the ammonium group of CH3NH3+ is the only hydrogen bonded interaction responsible for all temperature-dependent geometrical polymorphs of the system, including the most stable one that persists at low-temperatures, and the significance of all other noncovalent interactions has been overlooked. This study focussed only on the low temperature orthorhombic polymorph of CH3NH3PbI3 and CD3ND3PbI3, where D refers deuterium. Together with QTAIM, DORI and RDG based charge density analyses, the results of density functional theory calculations with PBE with and without van der Waals corrections demonstrate that the prevailing view of hydrogen bonding in CH3NH3PbI3 is misleading as it does not alone determine the a-b+a- tilting pattern of the PbI64- octahedra. This study suggests that it is not only the I{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}H/D\textendash N, but also the I{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}H/D\textendash C hydrogen/deuterium bonding and other noncovalent interactions (viz. tetrel-, pnictogen- and lump-hole bonding interactions) that are ubiquitous in the orthorhombic CH3NH3PbI3/CD3ND3PbI3 perovskite geometry. Their interplay determines the overall geometry of the polymorph, and are therefore responsible in part for the emergence of the functional optical properties of this material. This study also suggests that these interactions should not be regarded as the sole determinants of octahedral tilting since lattice dynamics is known to play a critical role as well, a common feature in many inorganic perovskites both in the presence and the absence of the encaged cation, as in CsPbI3/WO3 perovskites, for example.},

However, various challenges, such as dendrite growth, volume change and low coulombic efficiency, have limited the practical applications of Li metal anodes. Herein, we report a 3D porous Cu current collector with a unique biporous and bicontinuous structure fabricated               via               a phase inversion tape casting method. It has two types of pores: ``finger-like'' pores, serving as microchannels for efficient electrolyte and Li ion diffusion, and random small pores, serving as ``cages'' to accommodate Li deposits. Moreover, the high areal current density can be dissipated remarkably because of the large surface area, resulting in a stable solid electrolyte interphase and dendrite-free anode. The as-prepared porous Cu current collector maintains stable performance and ultra-low voltage hysteresis for over 2000 h in symmetric cells and maintains a CE of 97.6\% for 200 cycles in half cells. The porous Cu@Li//LiFePO               4               full cells also present excellent cycling and rate performances. In addition, the phase inversion method is very suitable for mass production, indicating great potential for practical applications of Li metal anodes.},

  abstract = {水是自然界中广泛分布的物质,其参与众多的物理、化学过程,并为生化反应等提供基本的环境。从原子水平认识水体系的存在形式、性质及行为对于从本质上理解相关领域的基本问题意义重大。水的微观形态可被一般性的看作是由水分子通过分子间氢键相互作用彼此聚集而形成的氢键网络体系,而不同尺寸的水团簇即是氢键网络的基本单元。水团簇的结构自由度及氢键网络的复杂行为使得微观水体系的性质不止局限于水分子自身的属性,而同时可以体现出团簇结构随尺寸和对称性的演化特性,以及通过氢键网络实现的构象转变、质子转移等过程。水分子间的氢键决定了氢键体系的结构属性并与水分子自身的电子结构密切相关,近年的实验观测更表明分子间氢键具有与共价键类似的电子结构,这暗示从电子结构角度出发针对水团簇体系进行系统性的理论研究可能为上述水氢键体系的性质与行为提供基础层次的理解。同时,水氢键体系的质子转移问题在各学科及相互间兴趣交叉的研究领域,也占有重要位置。本文使用量子力学第一性原理方法,从电子结构角度出发报道了对水团簇进行的系统性研究。我们分别阐述了水分子间氢键类共价特性的分子轨道表现、小尺寸环状水团簇的离域电子结构特性、环状水团簇中离域分子轨道与其几何结构平面化间的关联、水团簇中心四配位水分子的四氢键电子结构在中等尺寸水团簇中随尺寸变化的趋势,以及棱柱水团簇协同质子转移过程中的手性转变与识别这五个方面的内容。首先,我们选取水二聚物(H2O)2这一基本模型应用高精度第一性原理计算方法,从分子轨道角度出发研究了水分子间氢键的类共价特性。分子轨道分析发现了两条贯穿氢键区域的分子轨道,其贡献主要来自于氢键供体一侧的氧原子2p轨道。进一步的能量分解分析表明两个水分子之间存在不可忽略的诱导作用,其在两水分子相互作用能总吸引项中的比例高于10\%,这进一步支持了氢键的类共价特性。这一研究对理解冰、液态水、功能化材料以及生物系统中的氢键相互作用提供了新的分子轨道视角,并为本文基于电子结构来研究水团簇及氢键网络提供了基础指引。第二,准平面小水环(H2O)n(n=3-6)是构成更为复杂三维水团簇和液态水模型的的基本结构和功能单元,进一步理解分子间氢键相互作用在其中的特点对于认识复杂水团簇及氢键网络的性质具有基础性意义。我们应用密度泛函理论结合键特性分析方法,研究了这类小尺寸环状水团簇,结果表明n=3和4的两种小水环均出现离域于整个环并覆盖环中心区域的离域分子轨道,其贡献来自于各个水分子的氢氧原子,而在n=5和6的水环中相应离域轨道在环中心区域的轨道分布减弱。环状水团簇中的离域电子结构扩展了对水团簇中分子间氢键的认识,其展示的分子间氢键电子结构与体系几何结构间的相互影响及其随尺寸变化的特性为后续工作提供了指引。第三,承接上一研究,我们继续探索了n=3-6的小尺寸环状水团簇(H2O)n中离域电子结构与其几何结构平面化之间的联系。结果表明离域于水环氢键骨架中的三种离域分子轨道与体系能否形成稳定的平面结构密切相关,它们分别为轨道(I),主要由氧原子的孤对电子轨道O(2p)组成的分子轨道;轨道(II),主要由O(2p)-H(1s)形成的沿氢键方向的成键轨道;以及轨道(III),主要由O(2s)-H(1s)形成的成键轨道。当水环几何结构为平面结构时,利于水分子单体轨道之间针对这三种离域轨道实现彼此重叠最大化。进一步的能量分解分析显示,在所有的水环中轨道项的贡献在相互作用能总吸引项中的比例多于30\%,这再一次凸显了氢键系统的类共价特性。第四,基于对小尺寸水团簇的基本认识及研究中体现出的氢键电子结构随尺寸变化的规律,同时面向水团簇作为液态水静态模型时需要考虑的尺寸效应等问题,我们研究了接近液态水中水分子性质的4-配位水分子在团簇(H2O)n(n=17,19,20,21,23,25)中形成的四氢键电子结构,随团簇尺寸变化的趋势。结果表明,中心4-配位水分子与其最近邻水分子之间的相互作用随着团簇水分子数增多而减弱,中心4-配位水分子与次近邻水分子之间的相互作用能随着水分子数目的增多而增强。这表明中心4-配位水分子同最近邻和次近邻水分子之间的相互作用存在竞争关系。而光谱和电子密度分析表明中心水分子参与的最低频分子间振动与其和水笼之间的电子得失没有明显的尺寸依赖变化。此外,中心4-配位水分子四氢键电子结构的类共价特性被拓扑分析进一步阐明。我们希望这一理论研究能够为中等尺寸水团簇的研究及理解液态水中的氢键相互作用提供基本的理论参考。最后,基于以上基础认识,我们进一步探究了氢键网络中的动态过程。沿氢键的质子转移和手性转换过程是物理学及其与生命科学、材料科学等学科交叉领域的基本问题。其在手性识别、酶催化和药物制备等化工生产方面也具有重要意义。在本部分工作中,我们在理论上研究了可看作双层水环的小棱柱水团簇中单层内质子协同转移过程的手性转换和识别问题。结果表明,虽然质子转移初末态的能量变化很小,仅约为0.3 kcal/mol,但是振动圆二色谱(VCD)却提供了一个明显的手性特征峰区域(3000\textasciitilde 3500 cm-1),可以用来区别具有手性特征的初末态水团簇结构。这个区域的振动模式对应于层内氢键的拉伸,而且该区域的振动模式在红外和拉曼光谱中也具有易于观测的较强信号。另外,电子圆二色性谱(ECD)也展示了类似的识别特性。进一步的分子轨道分析显示,涉及两层间相互作用的轨道主要源于氧原子的2p轨道,并且层内协同质子转移过程可使相应层间轨道的能级抬升0.1 e V。此外,我们的研究还发现,氘原子的同位素取代能够在VCD谱上引起明显的特征峰移动,进而为可能的水团簇手性识别的实验探测提供了原理性设计思路。希望我们的发现能够在原子水平上为水团簇手性概念的夯实,乃至手性识别观测在相应实验过程中的实现起到促进作用。},

  abstract = {Development of next-generation high-energy lithium (Li) metal batteries is hindered by uncontrollable growth of Li dendrites and the unstable Li/electrolyte interface during repeated Li plating/stripping.           ,                             Development of next-generation high-energy lithium (Li) metal batteries is hindered by uncontrollable growth of Li dendrites and the unstable Li/electrolyte interface during repeated Li plating/stripping. To overcome these issues, artificial protection for Li metal prior to assembling the cell/battery is needed. Here we show a facile approach to               in situ               coating of a protected layer on the Li metal anode by directly placing a PVDF-HFP/AlF               3               modified Celgard separator on its surface. We find that AlF               3               can react with highly reactive Li metal and produce a LiF coating on Li metal               in situ               . This LiF-rich SEI layer can effectively passivate the highly active Li anode surface and suppress the lithium dendrite growth, forming a uniform structure on the Li/electrolyte interface that reduces interfacial impedance. Owing to the enhanced interface stability, the Li{$\Vert$}Li cell presents a stable polarization voltage for approximately 600 h compared with the blank cell (45 h). The Li{$\Vert$}LiFePO               4               cell with the composite separator has a high capacity retention of 78.3\% after 300 cycles at the 3C rate, exhibiting an improvement in the cycling life of high energy-density Li metal batteries.},

The calculation results including lattice constant, cohesive energy, work function and surface energy are in fair agreement with that derived from corresponding experiments. The various diffusion pathways such as diffusion of lithium as a substitution atom and various mechanisms are investigated with ab initio molecular dynamics. The energy barrier has been calculated corresponding to each possible pathway. Theoretically, we have identified that lithium can diffuse through copper thin film by successive nearest neighbor vacancy-atom exchanges, therefore, the nearest neighbor vacancy assisted jumping is deduced to be the most probable by comparing the different mechanisms. It is found that more free diffusion may be observed by increasing the number of copper vacancies in the thin film. It is also confirmed that the diffusion is more obvious as temperature is increased.},

  abstract = {Terminal \textendash OH group in PEO-based solid polymer electrolytes is the limiting factor of the electrochemical stability window, replacing it with more stable groups can accelerate the development of high-voltage solid-state batteries.           ,                             Due to higher energy density, high-voltage all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) have attracted increasing attention. However, they require solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) with wide electrochemical stability windows (ESW, typically {$>$}4.2 V) and high-stability against the Li anode. Nevertheless, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), the most widely used solid polymer electrolyte (SPE), can't tolerate a high-voltage over 4 V. Whether the main chain (\textendash C\textendash O\textendash C\textendash ) or the terminal hydroxide group (\textendash OH) is the limiting factor for the narrow ESW remains unknown. Herein, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(ethylene glycol)dimethyl ether (PEGDME) with different terminal groups are selected to answer this question. The results show that the reactive terminal \textendash OH group is the limiting factor towards applicability against high voltage and the Li anode. Replacing \textendash OH with more stable \textendash OCH               3               can significantly extend the ESW from 4.05 to 4.3 V, while improving the Li-anode compatibility as well (Li\textendash Li symmetric cells stably run for 2500 h at 0.2 mA cm               -2               ). Its practical application is further proved by developing PEGDME-based ASSLB pouch cells. The 0.53 mA cm               -2               Li\textendash LiFePO               4               and 0.47 mA h cm               -2               Li\textendash LiNi               0.5               Mn               0.3               Co               0.2               O               2               cells demonstrated high capacity retention of 97\% and 90\% after 210 cycles and 110 cycles, respectively. This work offers a new strategy for PEO-based high-voltage ASSLB development by changing the unstable terminal groups.},

Herein we proposed a failure mechanism of Li metal anode in Li-S cells based on the mechanistic investigation into the complex interactions between LiPSs and Li metal. The LiPSs participate the formation of inorganic layers in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in a LiPS-LiNO3 containing ether-based electrolyte. Li metal anode is well protected by the stable inorganic layer in-situ formed in an electrolyte containing 0.020 M Li2S5 (0.10 M sulfur) and 5.0 wt \% LiNO3. The metal anode with LiF-Li2Sx riched SEI rendered a stable Coulombic efficiency of 95\% after 233 cycles for Li-Cu half cells. A dendrite-free morphology of Li metal anode is observed under the harsh condition. When the LiPS is with a very high concentration of higher than 0.50 M sulfur in the organic electrolyte, the in-situ formed SEI cannot well maintain and the Li metal is gradually etched. Therefore, the polysulfide dissolution and diffusion should be delicately regulated to render a practical Li-S cell when the areal sulfur loading is high.},

  abstract = {The limitation of a high-voltage lithium (Li) metal battery lies in the absence of a robust electrolyte that can endure oxidation loss at a high-voltage cathode and suppress the dendrite growth at a Li metal anode.           ,                             The limitation of a high-voltage lithium (Li) metal battery lies in the absence of a robust electrolyte that can endure oxidation loss at a high-voltage cathode and suppress the dendrite growth at a Li metal anode. The challenge becomes especially serious when the cathode voltage reaches 5 V and above. Here, we developed an additive-containing electrolyte that can concurrently stabilize the Li metal anode and the 5 V class LiNi               0.5               Mn               1.5               O               4               (LNMO) cathode by introducing tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPFPB) to the traditional ethylene carbonate/ethyl methyl carbonate (EC/EMC) electrolyte. The boron element and pentafluorobenzene in TPFPB induce preferential formation of a steady and smooth interfacial layer on both the Li and LNMO electrodes, subsequently preventing the decomposition of the electrolyte, impeding the pulverization of the cathode electrode, and retarding the growth of Li dendrites. Accordingly, we accomplish high average coulombic efficiency of {$>$}99.2\% and superior capacity retention of 90\% after 500 cycles at 0.5C with charge cut-off voltage of 4.95 V, which is one of the highest results for cycling among 5 V-class Li metal batteries with 90\% capacity retention. This study provides essential technological implications for the electrolyte design for high-voltage Li\textendash metal batteries.},

  abstract = {Although traditional graphite anodes ensure the cycling stability and safety of lithium-ion batteries, the inherent drawbacks, particularly low theoretical specific capacity (372 mAh{$\cdot$}g{$^-$}1) and Li-free character, of such anodes limit their applications in high energy density battery systems, especially in lithium-sulfur and lithium-air batteries. Lithium metal has been considered as one of the best next-generation anode materials due to its extremely high theoretical specific capacity (3860 mAh{$\cdot$}g{$^-$}1) and low redox potential (-3.04 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode). The first generation of commercial rechargeable lithium metal batteries were developed by Moli Energy in the late 1980s and were not widely used due to several problems, including low coulombic efficiency, poor cycle stability, and safety hazards. These problems associated with the Li metal anode are mainly caused by lithium dendrite growth, electrode volume changes, and interface instability. During the charge and discharge processes, Li deposition is not uniform across the electrode surface. Due to the low surface energy and high migration energy of Li metal, dendrites are preferentially formed during Li deposition. These dendrites proceed to grow with successive battery cycling, penetrate the separator, and eventually reach the cathode, thereby causing short circuits and thermal runaway. Additionally, the growth of the lithium dendrite is inherently correlated with the reaction interface structure, and dendrite growth results in inhomogeneity of the SEI (solid electrolyte interface) which is inevitably formed on the Li metal surfaces. Moreover, the volume change of lithium metal anodes is of importance, particularly during battery cycling and Li stripping/deposition processes which make the SEI layers considerably unstable. SEI layers usually cannot withstand the mechanical deformation caused by volume changes; such layers continuously break and repair during cycling and consume large amounts of the electrolyte. Additionally, some Li dendrites could break and become wrapped by SEI layers to form electrically isolated ``dead'' Li, which results in the loss of active Li in the Li metal anode. All these factors are responsible for the failure of Li metal anodes. Herein, recent investigations on the failure mechanisms of lithium metal anodes are reviewed and summarized, including the formation of SEI layers on the surface of Li metal anodes, the behavior and mechanism of lithium dendrite growth, and the mechanism of ``dead'' lithium formation. Additionally, some advanced characterization techniques for investigating lithium metal anodes are introduced, including in situ tools, cryoelectron microscopy, neutron depth analysis technology, and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance technology. These techniques enable researchers to gain in-depth insights into the failure mechanisms of Li metal anodes.},

Herein an emerging electrolyte based on a simple solvation strategy was proposed for highly stable Li metal anodes in both coin and pouch cells. Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and lithium nitrate (LiNO3) were concurrently introduced into electrolyte, altering the solvation sheath of Li ions and then forming uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with abundant LiF and LiNxOy on a working Li metal anode that contributes to dendrite-free Li deposition. Ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency (99.96\%) and long lifespans (1000 cycles) were achieved when FEC/LiNO3 electrolyte was applied in working batteries. The solvation chemistry of electrolyte was further explored by molecular dynamics simulations and first-principles calculations. This work provides a fruitful insight on understanding the critical role of the solvation of Li ions in forming SEI and delivers an effective route to optimize electrolytes for safe Li metal batteries.},

  abstract = {We develop an alloy/polymer double-layered protective coating as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to mitigate immoderate dendrite growth during the cycling process for lithium metal anodes (LMAs).           ,                             Lithium metals have been considered as the most promising anode materials for next-generation rechargeable batteries due to their high theoretical capacity and low potential. Unfortunately, lithium metal anodes (LMAs) usually suffer from immoderate dendrite growth during the cycling process, which can cause serious safety concerns. Herein, we develop an alloy/polymer double-layered protective coating as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to mitigate the above problem. The inorganic alloy (LiF-rich Li\textendash Sb) layer is lithiophilic with high Li-ion conductivity, enabling dendrite-free plating/stripping of lithium at a high capacity. The organic polymer (commercial rubber) layer is highly flexible, keeping the artificial SEI stable during cycling. The use of double-layered coating results in significantly improved cycling stability for LMAs (500 h for a symmetric cell with a capacity of 1 mA h cm               -2               ) in both ether- and carbonate-based electrolytes, which is much better than for cells employing pristine lithium or single-alloy-protected lithium. It should be noted that the Li\textendash Sb alloy layer was created from a low-cost precursor (SbF               3               ). We believe that the design of double layer protective coating using low-cost raw materials provides a new pathway to achieve dendrite-free LMAs with an enhanced cycling life.},

  abstract = {A common issue plaguing battery anodes is the large consumption of lithium in the initial cycle as a result of the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase followed by gradual loss in subsequent cycles. It presents a need for prelithiation to compensate for the loss. However, anode prelithiation faces the challenge of high chemical reactivity because of the low anode potential. Previous efforts have produced prelithiated Si nanoparticles with dry air stability, which cannot be stabilized under ambient air. Here, we developed a one-pot metallurgical process to synthesize Li               x               Si/Li               2               O composites by using low-cost SiO or SiO               2               as the starting material. The resulting composites consist of homogeneously dispersed Li               x               Si nanodomains embedded in a highly crystalline Li               2               O matrix, providing the composite excellent stability even in ambient air with 40\% relative humidity. The composites are readily mixed with various anode materials to achieve high first cycle Coulombic efficiency (CE) of {$>$}100\% or serve as an excellent anode material by itself with stable cyclability and consistently high CEs (99.81\% at the seventh cycle and {$\sim$}99.87\% for subsequent cycles). Therefore, Li               x               Si/Li               2               O composites achieved balanced reactivity and stability, promising a significant boost to lithium ion batteries.},

They lead to low coulombic efficiency, short cycling lifespan and serious safety issues of Li metal batteries. Here we developed a facile strategy to prepare a nitrogen-doped-carbon/ZnO (NDC/ZnO) modified Cu foam (MCuF) current collector for Li metal anodes. The MCuF shows stable Li plating/stripping behavior with the Li dendrite-mitigation feature. The resultant half cells achieve a super long lifespan of over 600 cycles at 1 mA cm               -2               and over 200 cycles at a high current density 10 mA cm               -2               . Moreover, the full cell paired with LiFePO               4               also exhibits a long lifespan of over 150 cycles at a high rate of 5C. Such high performance can be attributed to the characteristics of MCuF, including its 3D porous structure with high conductivity, enlarged surface area and uniform lithophilic NDC/ZnO sites. We believed that our work can provide a facile strategy for fabricating high-performance 3D current collectors for Li metal storage and stable Li metal batteries.},

  abstract = {In anode free batteries (AFBs), the current collector acts as anode simultaneously and has large volume expansion which is generally considered as a negative effect decreasing the structural stability of a battery. Moreover, despite many studies on the fast lithium diffusion in the current collector materials of AFB such as copper and aluminum, the involved Li diffusion mechanism in these materials remains poorly understood. Through first-principles calculation and stress-assisted diffusion equations, here we study the Li diffusion mechanism in several current collectors and related alloys and clarify the effect of volume expansion on Li diffusion respectively. It is suggested that due to the lower Li migration barriers in aluminum and tin, they should be more suitable to be used as AFB anodes, compared to copper, silver, and lead. The Li diffusion facilitation in copper with a certain number of vacancies is proposed to explain why the use of copper with a thickness 100 nm as the protective coating on the anode improves the lifetime of the batteries. We show that the volume expansion has a positive effect on Li diffusion via mechanical\textendash electrochemical coupling. Namely, the volume expansion caused by Li diffusion will further induce stress which in turn affects the diffusion. These findings not only provide in-depth insight into the operating principle of AFBs, but also open a new route toward design of improved anode through utilizing the positive effect of mechanical\textendash electrochemical coupling.},
